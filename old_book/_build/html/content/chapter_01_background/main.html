<p>The purpose of this study is to deduce what underlying parameters most strongly control a planet’s choice of tectonic mode. The fundamental question regards the existence or otherwise of a well-defined ‘tectonic phase diagram’ in which primarily temperature defines the proper global geodynamic regime at any given time. Phase spaces are defined by their phase transitions, and in the field of planetary geodynamics, only one such transition is well-attested and amenable to study: the emergence on Earth of plate tectonics from an earlier pre-tectonic state of disputed character. The Early Earth is therefore key to the larger question of tectonic modality.</p>
<p>In this review chapter, we will present a brief history of scholarship on the topic, summarise the chief lines of evidence, and discuss the leading hypotheses regarding the divergent fates of Earth and our most familiar planetary cousins. Our line of inquiry will be illustrated with some simple one-dimensional modelling. We will not discuss in detail the analytical and numerical intricacies of the problem at hand, which will instead be related as appropriate in the prefacing remarks of the relevant results chapters (Chapters 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6); nor will we provide much background or context for our methodological approach, which is treated separately (Chapter 2 &amp; Chapter 7).</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath, a petition of over 300 signatures from attendees at the IAU meeting itself protested the new classification, which had been decided by a partial convention of the union rather than a general colloquium, perhaps to avoid protest <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id633" title="Edwin Cartlidge.

<p>Stern’s definition is a profound revision of the cosmos, but one which is well-argued and well-suited to the purposes of planetary scientists. Under Stern’s mandate, not only Pluto and Eris, but also the asteroid belt objects Ceres and Vesta, as well as various ‘satellite planets’ - Earth’s moon, Pluto’s partner Charon, and most of the satellites of the outer gas giants - all would be considered equally as planets. Such an expansion puts the geophysical, atmospheric, and climatic aspects of planets front and centre, above and beyond their orbital or formational histories. It sets the stage epistemologically for a fundamental deepening of our understanding of the unique processes that govern sub-stellar objects in our universe, and - as we will discuss later (Chapter 8) - may be regarded in retrospect as a milestone event in the birth of a new field of focussed, integrated, holistic planetary science.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Heat and geometry: planetary basics<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-and-geometry-planetary-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The geophysical definition of a planet provides some clarification on what should and what shouldn’t be included as essential considerations of our topic. A planet is a gravitationally-bound ellipsoidal object, not currently or formerly made of plasma, surrounded by mostly empty space. Such a definition has some immediate implications. The chemical and gravitational prescriptions of Stern’s definition provide an upper and lower spatial scale respectively: anywhere from the radius of Mimas, at 200 km the smallest rounded body in the solar system <span id="id11">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id292" title="Katharina Lodders and Bruce Fegley. The Planetary Scientist's Companion. Oxford University Press, 1 edition edition, 11 1998.">Lodders and Fegley, 1998</a>]</span>, to the radius of Jupiter, about 70,000 km, above which any additional mass tends to be compressed without increasing planet size <span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id640" title="Gibor Basri and Michael E Brown. PLANETESIMALS TO BROWN DWARFS: what is a planet? Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci., 34(1):193–216, 4 2006.">Basri and Brown, 2006</a>]</span>. It implies a temporal scale too: between the atmospheric (hours) and geological (gigayear) timescales.</p>
<p>Other implicit constraints are more subtle. Because a planet is qualified by its shape - a function of mass and matter - it is parsimonious to stipulate that these quantities are connate to each planet and cannot be changed. Of course, in reality, such changes do occur: consider the formation of Earth’s moon from a putative impact with a Mars-sized planetoid in the Hadean <span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id345" title="Robin M Canup. Forming a moon with an earth-like composition via a giant impact. Science, 338(6110):1052–1055, 10 2012.">Canup, 2012</a>]</span>, or the hypothesised delivery to Earth of a significant mass of volatiles by icy planetoids <span id="id14">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id346" title="T C Owen and A Bar-Nun. Volatile contributions from icy planetesimals. In Origin of the Earth and Moon, pages 459–471. adsabs.harvard.edu, 0 2000.">Owen and Bar-Nun, 2000</a>]</span>. In the system outlined here, however, such events would be considered ‘catastrophic’ - outside of the prescribed spatiotemporal scales of the subject, and violating the prescribed conservative quantities of the problem; in essence, such a calamity would be considered the ‘death’ of the original planet and the ‘birth’ of a new one.</p>
<p>There are also more sustained violations: erosion of planetary atmospheres into space, for example <span id="id15">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id644" title="Yu N Kulikov, H Lammer, H I M Lichtenegger, N Terada, I Ribas, C Kolb, D Langmayr, R Lundin, E F Guinan, S Barabash, and H K Biernat.

Swapping rocks: ejection and exchange of surface material among the terrestrial planets. Meteoritics, 1993.">Melosh and Tonks, 1993</a>]</span>. Such endemic exceptions, however, plague all systems; hence we will dub them ‘pathological’, requiring careful handling but not deference.</p>
<p>Planets, then, can be said to be spheroidal, sub-stellar objects of a fixed mass and bulk chemistry. Within these parameters, however, there are considerable degrees of freedom:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The geometric characters of the spheroid can change - eccentricity, radius, and obliquity - with consequences for the centre of mass, the gravitational field, and the tidal coupling of the planet with any extra-planetary systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution of mass can change, anywhere between the extremes of an arbitrarily thin hollow shell and an arbitrarily dense core, with consequences for the moment of inertia and rate of rotation as well as the gravitational field and the gravitational binding energy. The total mass, of course, cannot change - this would be ‘catastrophic’ - hence the gravitational pull of a planet at a sufficient distance above the surface is fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>The angular velocity of the planet can change due to internal forces and geometric transformations. Angular momentum can also change, though necessarily only by interactions with extra-planetary bodies: when these interactions are periodic, systematic, and persistent over geological time, they may be parameterised as an intrinsic forcing within the planet; otherwise, they may be considered ‘pathological’ (if frequent) or ‘catastrophic’ (if infrequent) exceptions, outside the intrinsic scope of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The chemical makeup of the planet can change. Indeed, all the degrees of freedom within any constituent molecules of a planet are available as degrees of freedom of the planet as a whole, as are all the possibilities for the breaking of old bonds and the forging of new ones.</p></li>
<li><p>The isotopic makeup of a planet can change, albeit largely without consequence for bulk chemistry - hence their enormous analytical utility as tracers and monitors for Earth sciences. Earth is overwhelmingly composed of less than 300 stable nuclides <span id="id18">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id347" title="Michael Thoennessen and Bradley Sherrill. From isotopes to the stars. Nature, 473(7345):25, 2011.">Thoennessen and Sherrill, 2011</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The elemental inventory of a planet can change; here, however, we must be careful. The decay of short-lived radioactive nuclides like Uranium-235 and Thorium-232 into daughter elements are significant to the system; the decays of extremely long-lived nuclides like Uranium-238 and Calcium-48 are not significant over ‘planetary’ timescales as stipulated above (“Nudat 2” n.d.). Decay of non-radioactive nuclides due to the finite half-lives of subatomic particles are not significant on any reasonable timescale and are not available as degrees of freedom for planetary processes as we choose to consider them.</p></li>
<li><p>The spatial distribution of chemical and elemental species can change: to wit, the differentiation of the felsic crust, mafic mantle, and metallic core due to gravitational forcing; but also, the partitioning of rare-earth elements and radiogenics into the continental crust due to purely chemical factors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these degrees of freedom entail certain endothermic or exothermic reactions, and these naturally chain one to another in complex ways. The net result, however, is the exhaustion of all possible gradients and the conversion of all potential energy into diffuse kinetic energy, i.e. heat. But what is the total internal energy of a planet - its enthalpy?</p>
<p>Because there is no such thing as ‘absolute’ enthalpy, it is necessary to first define a natural point of reference for the system against which changes in the energy budget may be compared. Thankfully, the stipulations we have already made regarding the conserved quantities of planets, as well as the limitations we have provided on relevant spatiotemporal scales and the resultant pruning of available degrees of freedom, imply one fairly reliable, though somewhat counter-intuitive, reference point: not the planet’s initial condition, but rather its ‘rest state’ after a sufficient span of time.</p>
<p>Consider a situation where the Earth as a whole exchanges no heat with its environment. In fact, this is a surprisingly credible simplification: the global geothermal flux is estimated at only 47 terawatts <span id="id19">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id646" title="J H Davies and D R Davies.

<p>What is the ‘ultimate’ temperature of an isenthalpic planet such as we have described? This will be the temperature obtained at an arbitrarily remote time in the future - long enough for all permissible degrees of freedom to be exploited. At this time, only heat remains: a planet has no more tricks to perform. It transpires that this number is not all that difficult to derive, nor so uncertain as we might assume - at least in comparison to the inverse problem, which is fraught with controversy.</p>
<p>On ‘Ultimate Earth’, the radiogenic nuclides have completely decayed into heat and stable daughters, while the stable nuclides have sorted by density from top to bottom - a crude but serviceable assumption. The Earth is now a perfect sphere of the smallest possible size, and its rotation has completely ceased due to tidal interactions with other cosmic masses.</p>

When we instead venture to calculate the temperature starting from the presumed initial condition of the Earth, we obtain an Ultimate Earth temperature an order of magnitude higher - 40,000 to 50,000 K, about 2.75 * 10^32 joules. In other words, the Earth’s heat has fallen by a factor of ten over its 4.5 billion year history.</p>
<p>The reason we can be fairly confident about these figures is that they are dominated by gravitational potential energy and the heat of accretion, which can both be trivially derived analytically from Earth’s mass; cumulatively, these factors account for about 10^32 joules of Ultimate Earth’s heat budget, about 93%. Some 88% of this energy is converted instantly into heat upon accretion; another 9% is released through differentiation, of which 8.7% is due to the core and 0.27% is due to the crust. Only 3% of the Earth’s original gravitational binding energy remains as potential energy which could feasibly be released as work and heat. The remaining degrees of freedom - orbital, chemical, and nuclear - add up to a little over 10^31 joules, but together make up the majority of the remaining energy available to be released. Interestingly, the amount of heat that could theoretically be liberated by gravitational sorting of nuclides - i.e. the formation of continents - is comparable to the remaining radiogenic budget of the Earth. If as much continental volume were to be produced in the next 5 Gy as in the previous, it would represent a significant proportion of geothermal flux.</p>
<p>In reality, the Earth is not isenthalpic: it receives solar heat and sheds geothermal heat into space. We observe here that some 89% of the Earth’s heat has been lost to space since formation. This number is very close to the 88% of heat that would have been released geologically instantaneously at accretion. As Lord Kelvin famously calculated <span id="id26">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id650" title="William Thomson. XV.— on the secular cooling of the earth. Earth Environ. Sci. Trans. R. Soc. Edinb., 23(1):157–169, 1862.">Thomson, 1862</a>]</span>, the maximum timescale to reach a present-day geotherm from a wholly molten state is a mere tens of millions of years, and much, much shorter than that if more active thermal processing is at work. Hence it is conceivable, though unverifiable, that almost all of Earth’s accretionary heat was lost shortly after formation, with freezing of the core and radiogenic decay since accounting for most if not all of the observed geothermal fluxes at magnitudes similar to today’s.</p>
<p>We have laid out what is admittedly a fairly rudimentary construct to commence our thesis. However, we argue it furnishes the appropriate ‘ballpark’ figures and situates the intuition in the proper place for a truly planetary way of thinking about thermodynamics and flow. The essential lesson of the Ultimate Earth concept is that the overall thermal regime of a planet is in no hurry to reach equilibrium with space; that in fact, over the lifetime of many planets - curtailed by the circumstances of their host stars to mere billions, rather than tens of billions of years - no state resembling Ultimate Earth will ever be achieved by star-bound worlds. In short, heat is not destiny for a planet.</p>

<p>It is incredible to consider that, within the lifetime of a single PhD student, a family of nine known planets has become a universe of thousands.</p>
<p>The expansion in scope of planetary sciences has occurred so rapidly it is easy to lose track of what has changed. Discoveries, in our solar system and beyond, are moving faster than theory, and it seems a major revolution in our understanding of planets waits to be realised. An atmosphere of genuine hope and excitement surrounds the field - both within the academy and beyond.</p>
<p>Here we present a brief overview of relevant recent discoveries in our home solar system and beyond.</p>

This exploration is yielding provocative evidence that challenges our understanding of planetary dynamics.</p>
<p>While much of note has been uncovered on the rocky planets of our inner solar system, especially Mars, Venus, and the Moon, here we will discuss more recent discoveries whose import has arguably not yet been fully recognised in the broader geodynamics literature - planetary bodies that were supposed to be inert, which have proved to be full of activity. On the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and far out beyond the orbit of Neptune, young, dynamic surfaces are being revealed, speaking to active internal processes that may support life - and hold invaluable clues to untangling the history of Earth and the deeper questions of tectonics.</p>

<p>Perhaps because we have no local examples, super-Earths have invited particularly intense speculation. Much debate surrounds the question of whether such worlds should be expected to have plate tectonics or not.

<p>The super-Earth debate arguably generates more heat than light, but it is nonetheless illuminating in that it reveals the true uncertainties of geodynamics where we are unable to rely on the arrogance of fact, as we can on Earth. It prompts consideration of whether we would even have a notion of plate tectonics if we did not observe it in action at home, and invites speculation about what completely alien solutions may exist to the fundamental question of planets.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>Geodynamics: an evolving discipline<a class="headerlink" href="#geodynamics-an-evolving-discipline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tectonics, from the Greek tectonicus, ‘pertaining to building’, is a body of theory which endeavours to characterise the manner in which the spatial configuration of the landmasses changes over time. It is one of the foundational theories of natural history and arguably comprises the backbone of modern geosciences. However, tectonic theory is not, per se, a ‘dynamic’ theory with the power to explain how, or indeed, why such reconfiguration occurs. It is in this distinction that the field of geodynamics arises.</p>
<p>Geodynamics is to the theory of plate tectonics as genetics is to the theory of evolution. It seeks to interface the enormously successful narrative power of tectonics with the explanatory and predictive power of the underlying laws of physics - that is, classical mechanics and thermodynamics. Geodynamics defined in this way is necessarily younger than tectonic theory, which is itself only two generations old; as a discipline, it is arguably yet to move beyond descriptive science and acquire true predictive and prescriptive powers.</p>

<p>Such a bill of facts, once collected, testifies strongly to the existence of a global assortative process with both toroidal and poloidal components.

<h4><span class="section-number">1.4.2.1. </span>The Naive Theory of plate tectonics<a class="headerlink" href="#the-naive-theory-of-plate-tectonics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To illustrate how our understanding of global geodynamics has evolved, it is helpful to clearly articulate a ‘Naive Theory’ of plate tectonics to serve as a null hypothesis for the discussion. According to the Naive Theory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Earth is in a state of whole-mantle convection driven mainly by accretionary heat escaping from the core.</p></li>
<li><p>Material and thermal heterogeneities, while certainly present, do not determine the global convective planform.</p></li>
<li><p>Global convection is powered by the thermal gradient between the deep Earth and outer space, and should be expected to dwindle as this heat reservoir is depleted. Hence, we would expect elevated global geothermal fluxes in the past relative to the present.</p></li>
<li><p>Plate motions represent the upper limb of these whole-mantle cells, with the plates themselves in some sense propelled by the overall mantle current.</p></li>
<li><p>Mantle-scale upwellings should be expected to map to mid-ocean ridges and downwellings to subduction zones. Implicitly, plate scale forces such as ridge push, basal traction, and slab pull should cooperate to transport the plates according to whole-mantle circulation, and ought to be of similar magnitudes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the ‘Naive Theory’ is how the solid Earth would be expected to behave if it was dominantly basally heated, subject to linear viscosity laws, and chemically homogeneous to a first-order estimation. Such a rheology is powerfully amenable to numerical analysis and has been extensively studied as a common end-member behaviour for all sorts of systems in a state of thermally-driven flow (this thesis treats with similar rheologies in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4). Indeed, the ‘Naive Theory’ serves as an excellent approximation for systems ranging from Earth’s atmosphere to Campbell’s tomato soup.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">1.4.2.4. </span>Going beyond the Naive Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#going-beyond-the-naive-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We have employed the Naive Theory here mostly as a discursive device. However, though no theory of this form has ever been seriously advocated by qualified geodynamicists, the Naive Theory is a surprisingly close representation of common opinion regarding solid Earth dynamics, both among the lay public and in the non-specialist planetary and geoscientific literature. This can be seen, for instance, in the generally accepted supposition that Mars and the Moon lack active tectonics due to their lesser size, and hence - presumably - their more rapid rate of cooling. The resilience of Naive-like assumptions about the Earth is likely due in some degree to the fact that, as misguided as the theory is, its elegant formulation and superficially potent explanatory qualities still recommend it over alternative models, the underlying causal mechanisms of which remain elusive.</p>
<p>So, what might an improved, unified geodynamic model of the Earth entail? We can draw up a decent catalogue of what such a model would require by merely inverting the assumptions of our by now well-falsified null hypothesis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Earth is in a state of mixed convection on multiple interconnected wavelengths, with the dominant driver being negative buoyancy of the lithosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Chemical and thermal heterogeneities are significant and have a first-order effect on global convective planform.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of convective vigour being determined by global temperatures, temperatures are in fact determined by convective vigour, which has a range of complicated dependencies. Global heat flux can go inversely with global temperature and potentially exhibit many other counter-intuitive feedbacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Plate distributions powerfully condition global flow, and are themselves a function more of historical and local contingencies than of deep perturbations.</p></li>
<li><p>Mantle-driven upwellings and downwellings are to some degree separate from surface-driven movements, with the two systems at times reinforcing and at times disrupting one another.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What conceivable system, governed by what conceivable laws, could provide for these behaviours? Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made from various quarters to provide a new paradigm that satisfies these requirements without stipulating causes beyond the essentials of thermally driven flow. Two aspects of this paradigm will now be discussed: the discovery of tectonic modes, and the special role of continents.</p>

While limitless novelty can be generated with more and more complex material configurations, the real test of the paradigm will be to show that single-material, mathematically parsimonious laws, like the viscoplastic formulation that enables episodic behaviour, can continue to generate substantially original behaviours that can be called truly new tectonic modes.</p>

<p>So far, we have encountered mode transitions as diagnostic or taxonomic classifications of viable systems for processing geothermal heat. This is a geophysical analogue of how weather and climate may be understood fundamentally as systems for processing solar heat.

<p>We have already seen that a planet’s geothermal flux must not be naively expected to decrease as a function of time, or even as a function of temperature: both may indeed have the opposite effect.

According to this history, geothermal flux starts high when global temperatures are high, dips through the single-plate era, then rises with the advent of subduction; at each stage, the tectonic mode is a direct and unitary consequence of the state variables of global relict and radiogenic heat.

<p>These lines of evidence suggest a new model: one in which tectonic mode is treated not as a state variable or a mere product of state variables, but rather as a process variable - a configuration that flows through the system, like heat itself <span id="id212">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id416" title="A Lenardic. The diversity of tectonic modes and thoughts about transitions between them. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 10 2018.">Lenardic, 2018</a>]</span>. Under such a model, multiple tectonic modes could be seen as coequal simultaneous possible configurations for each planet, each manifesting certain exigencies and instabilities that could spontaneously and unpredictably precipitate a transition into an alternative mode. Thus two planets identical in every way may, in sufficient time, evolve to be more and more unalike, until the ultimate logic of heating and cooling forces both to converge on stagnation and eventual, frigid death.</p>
<p>Though the new model is not yet well quantified, there are many facts we have already seen that should predispose us to suspect it may be true. Consider again the analogy with weather and climate. Non-linearities and chaotic behaviour are as influential there as it is here claimed they are in the solid Earth. However, there are two key differences. Firstly, planetary tectonic mode not only processes its heat source, but feeds back into it by determining the rate at which it is conveyed to space. On Earth, we see evidence of this effect most definitively in the lower-than-expected modern Urey ratio, which implies that Phanerozoic surface processes have in fact created a much more efficient channel for extracting heat from the core than existed prior. Secondly, planets have long-term memories. While the oldest climate information with direct relevance to the modern atmosphere is ~200 My old carbon, Earth’s tectonic processes can be affected by circumstances billions of years old: for instance, when a buoyant Archaean craton impacts a subduction zone and forces a reconfiguration of plate stresses or even plate boundaries <span id="id213">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id208" title="W G Mason, L Moresi, P G Betts, and M S Miller. Three-dimensional numerical models of the influence of a buoyant oceanic plateau on subduction zones. Tectonophysics, 483(1–2):71–79, 2 2010.">Mason <em>et al.</em>, 2010</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>While ultimately it may be tempting to cut through the uncertainty and hysteresis and return to the basic intuition that the Earth is becoming thermally ‘older’ with time, with less net heat to go around and hence less prospect for activity, it must again be stressed that the actual rates of flux, even in our elevated present regime, are very small with respect to tectonic timescales. Even a seemingly irreversible process like the formation of cratons on Earth is conceptually not undoable: as we calculated earlier, sufficient potential energy remains inside the Earth to effect the ‘rewinding’ of that particular degree of freedom. In principle, it might even be possible to establish a circle - or, more properly, a very shallow spiral - of alternating tectonic modes, which, if sufficiently regular, might be construable as a distinctive tectonic mode of its own: consider episodic overturn <span id="id214">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../references.html#id401" title="Louis Moresi and Viatcheslav Solomatov. Mantle convection with a brittle lithosphere: thoughts on the global tectonic styles of the earth and venus. Geophys. J. Int., 133:669–682, 1998.">Moresi and Solomatov, 1998</a>]</span>. Such a cycle, despite the inevitable ratcheting of entropy, could nonetheless conceivably be stable even on timescales comparable to the present age of our universe.</p>

<p>The emerging model of tectonic modes will demand novel and imaginative approaches. This study’s particular methodology will be discussed forthwith (Chapter 2); for now, we must conclude with a reaffirmation of the essential thesis. The age of planets as dumb rocks mechanistically unspooling into space has come to an end. Felled by a torrent of empirical evidence at home and far beyond, that conception is now being replaced with a new one: broader, richer, more ripe with possibilities than what came before; but also challenging, subtle, and bewilderingly vast. It is to be hoped that this new paradigm will in time yield new tools; tools which, if wielded with boldness and ingenuity, may open up the tomb of Earth’s ancient past, and lay bare the pathways of life.</p>
