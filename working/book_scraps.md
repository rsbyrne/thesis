The most efficient means for any planet to shed its heat into space is by some form of free convection - the mass movement of bulk materials driven by thermal density contrasts. Like any fluid, these geodynamic flows are each governed by their own peculiar 'rheology' or flow-law; and although a planet's choice of rheology is entirely determined by each planet's own internal properties, each rheology in itself unites families of similarly-behaving systems irrespective of physical or chemical distinctions - from the heaving of vast continents to the decorative swirls of a lava lamp.

It is this fundamental identity of flow physics that makes planetary systems amenable to laboratory analysis, be it via heated wax models or massive numerical simulations. While each such model is a meaningful scientific artifact in itself, the scale-independent quality of flow naturally invites us to make comparison between these artifacts and the larger systems we find ourselves immersed in. By such comparisons, we perceive that Earth's mid-ocean ridges represent thermal upwellings of the underlying mantle, and the ocean trenches the downwellings.
