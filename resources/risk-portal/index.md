title: Welcome to the Victorian COVID Risk Portal
---

This **daily-updated** portal provides an at-a-glance overview of the unfolding COVID-19 situation in Victoria for the convenience of analysts and policy advisors. It is not intended for general public consumption. The portal currently aggregates data from Facebook, Google, and government sources using a system of algorithms devised by the University of Melbourne's [Transport, Health, and Urban Design Lab](https://thud.msd.unimelb.edu.au/home).

More datasets, visualisations, and other features are rapidly being added and feedback is warmly invited to shape this resource to policymaker needs. For queries, suggestions, and support, please contact <rohan.byrne@unimelb.edu.au> (engineer), <rajith.vidanaarachchi@unimelb.edu.au> (analyst), or <jason.thompson@unimelb.edu.au> (team lead).
