*Charts updated as often as the source datas (Google and Facebook) update. Case data from government sources. The 'mobility score' is the product of a normalising algorithm applied to the source datas with the intention of minimising signals that are not related to lockdown policy. Values of 1 reflect normal or 'COVID normal' behaviours (median of the highest twelve records for that region and day of the week), and values around 0 indicate peak lockdown behaviours (median of the lowest twelve records for that region and day of the week). For clarity, public holidays have been omitted from these summary charts, but are still available in the underlying data. The data have been aggregated to council area, then averaged city-wide by population.*

This portal provides access to Australia-oriented mobility datasets with the intention of aiding researchers and journalists and promoting a well-informed national conversation on public health. Established in early 2020 as part of the Doherty Institute-led initial scientific response to COVID, today the portal continues to update four times daily (typically with a two- or three- day delay) and offers both analytical products and bulk datasets on the changes in human movement through and beyond the lockdowns.

This portal was recently rebuilt from the ground up, and additional features will continue to be added or readded every couple of days. Much more can be made available upon request; media enquiries are also welcome. Email <rohan.byrne@unimelb.edu.au>.
