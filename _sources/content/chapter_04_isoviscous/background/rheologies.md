# Linear rheologies: the isoviscous case

When we talk about rheology, or a materials' style of flow, we are primarily talking about its viscosity function - the expression that maps the local viscosity at any point in the fluid to its context, history, or environment. While most fluids in the real world have complex 'Non-Newtonian' rheologies in which pressure and viscosity are co-dependent, mantle convection studies have often relied on simpler Newtonian rheologies that are more numerically and analytically tractable. These are what we here call 'linear rheologies'.

The bulk of all mantle convection studies focus on one of the following three linear rheologies:
- **Isoviscous** or 'constant viscosity' flow.
- **Arrhenius**-type exponentially temperature-dependent viscosity.
- **Spatialised** viscosity - either arbitrarily zoned or simply depth-dependent.

This two-part investigation will focus on the isoviscous and Arrhenius types. The former can be viewed as a special case of the latter, so it makes a fitting launching-off point for this study.
