    "Tectonics is known to us through its sensible processes of orogeny, seismicity, and volcanism. The energy available to carry out these permutations ultimately derives from the depletion of the thermal gradient of the Earth’s hot interior with space, mitigated to an uncertain degree by internal heat production via radiogenics, core despinning, and other means. Estimates of global heat flow vary from around $42$ terawatts {cite}`Dye2012-cx` to upwards of $47$ terawatts {cite}`Davies2010-gz`. Of this power, a mere $1\\%$ is thought to be necessary to account for all the geological activity witnessed on Earth {cite}`Turcotte2014-by`; if our Earth is a heat engine, it is a weak one."

    "A geodynamically rigid planet with Earth’s interior temperature would not be able to access even these modest energies: it would be trapped by its flat, linear conductive geotherm. That the planetary geotherm is evidently much greater than this is evidence that more kinetic processes are at work. The dimensionless temperature gradient is related to the Nusselt number or $\\mathrm{Nu}$, the ratio of the measured temperature gradient to the reference gradient, which is the purely conductive geotherm. It can be given in terms of the rate of change of the dimensionless potential temperature $\\theta^*$ with respect to dimensionless depth $y^*$ {cite}`Schubert2001-ea`:\n",

    "\n",
    "When dimensionless parameters are used - unit mantle thickness and unit temperature range - the conductive geotherm for a non-curved domain is exactly one. Hence, for square geometries, the dimensionless temperature gradient $\\mathrm{Nu}$ does double-duty as the heat transfer efficiency: it is the factor by which heat transfer is greater than it would be under a scenario of pure conduction. For curved domains, where the outer length is greater than the inner length, the conductive geotherm is proportionately lesser as it is in a sense ‘stretched out’ across the circumference; letting $f$ be the ratio of inner to outer lengths (either circumferential or radial), $\\mathrm{Nu}$ in these cases diverges from the dimensionless temperature gradient by a factor of $f$ for cylinders and $f^2$ for shells. Though harder to measure in practice than in theory, it is implicit that Earth’s Nusselt number must be much greater than one; it is sometimes cited in the order of $10$ {cite}`Tackley1996-vw`, which is characteristic of laminar (sub-turbulent) flow {cite}`White1984-fn`."

For high values of $\\mathrm{Ra}$, convection is much more efficient than conduction for transporting heat, leading to high fluid velocities and flow regimes grading from sluggish to laminar to turbulent. For low $\\mathrm{Ra}$, conduction dominates, and the material is largely or totally quiescent. Separating these two domains is an often empirically-obtained value, the Critical Rayleigh Number or $\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$, which is innate to each fluid; $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is sometimes given in terms of $\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$ as $r = \\frac{Ra}{\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}}$. Values of $\\mathrm{Ra}$ in most applications can be quite high, and so are usually represented in decimal orders of magnitude; for mantle materials as modelled hereafter, for example, the critical $\\mathrm{Ra}$ can be shown to be somewhere between $10^3-10^4$, with 'Earthlike' behaviour scarcely manifest anywhere below $10^7$ (Chapter 3).

In fact, for simple cases such as this of planar basally-heated isoviscous flow, an expression for $\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$ due to arbitrary perturbations can be derived from the assumptions already held using linear stability analysis. First consider the state of a purely conducting system at thermal equilibrium:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta^{'*} \\equiv T^{'*} - T_c^* $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Before perturbation, the pressure gradient forces were defined solely by the hydrostatic pressure $p_c$ - the pressure field which is purely sufficient to counteract the force of gravity. After the introduction of the perturbation, but before the resultant perturbed state is realised, the pressure field is modified in two ways: by the buoyancy anomaly of the perturbation, but also by the contribution of the modified density of the parcel to pre-perturbative hydrostatic pressure. Taking this into account, we can define a true perturbation pressure $\\Pi^{'*}$ as:\n",

The expression defines a curve through the space of $\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$ vs dimensionless wavenumber which has a single minimum: this is $\\lambda^{*, cr}$, the wavelength of perturbation at which $\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$ is at its lowest. Perturbations near this critical wavelength will tend to grow the fastest, since, as it were, they experience the highest ‘local’ *Rayleigh* number.

Consider, though, the significance of driving the Rayleigh number below the minimum critical value. This is equivalent to stating that no perturbations at all - not even the least stable ones - are able to grow quicker than the diffusive timescale. At the minimum critical value itself, it follows that only perturbations of $\\sqrt{2}$ scale will grow; this value nonetheless serves adequately as the $\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$ of the entire fluid, since a perturbation of such a wavelength can always be discovered in any real system - if geometry permits.\n",

Assuming that the fastest-growing perturbation will ultimately come to dominate all others, what we need is an expression for the velocity field in terms of $\\lambda$ that we can solve for the critical wavelength $\\lambda_{cr}$ {cite}`Rayleigh1916-il`.\n",

    "We have already established that when the *Rayleigh* number is supercritical, heat may be more rapidly transported by advection than by diffusion.

As the abiabat approaches the system boundaries, a point of diminishing returns is reached, and conductive processes take precedence once more. These regions of conductivity are the convecting system’s boundary layers.\n",

Authors have differed, however, on the proper value of $\\beta$. Though the canonicity of the analytically-derived value of one third is beyond dispute, it is clear from the divergent results of numerous studies that, in any real scenario, many more variables than we have accounted for must enter the equation. Time-dependence, long-lived thermal heterogeneities, aspect ratio, internal heating, and countless other factors all have a part to play. Obtaining robust scaling laws that account for all these factors is the vexing business of this thesis."

    "When $r<1$, the trivial first solution above describes the only stable steady-state solution and represents pure conduction, just as we would expect when $\\mathrm{Ra}<\\mathrm{Ra}_{cr}$. When $r>1$, this solution becomes unstable, and the only stable solutions become the positive and negative valencies of the second expression above, which represent clockwise and counterclockwise unicellular convection. The ‘choice’ of the system to devolve from the unbiased conductive solution to one of either the left- or right-biased convective solutions is termed a ‘pitchfork bifurcation’, the first of many we will encounter; its existence proves that mantle convection is chaotic.\n",

    "When $Pr>b+1$, the above expression gives the value of $r$ above which the two fundamental convective solutions are in fact not stable; in other words, it is the criterion for the instability of steady convection. It is also another kind of bifurcation - a *Hopf* bifurcation. Around a *Hopf* point, stable solutions are periodic and cyclical; solutions which cross the bifurcation are hence ‘captured’ by it and cycle through a finite set of states ad infinitum, until or unless those oscillations become great enough to tip a system into the zone of attraction of another *Hopf* point. Complex paths through phase space can thus be drawn which represent very high-order periodic solutions for the system that resist analytical description. Dubbed ‘strange attractors’, they are the iconic property of chaos theory.\n",

    "So far, for the sake of argument, we have assumed a finite *Prandtl* number. This of course contravenes one of the foundational assumptions of our broader analysis. Before moving on, it behooves us to ask whether the chaotic behaviours observed in the Lorenz equations hold in the limit that $Pr\\to\\infty$.\n",

    "The fixed points of these new equations are the same as for the Lorenz equations, as is the conductive solution when $A=B=C=0$, which as before is stable only for subcritical $\\mathrm{Ra}$; however, the convective solutions can be shown to be stable for all $r>1$. We might take this to imply that mantle convection cannot be chaotic after all. However, it must be recalled that the Lorenz analysis begins with severe truncation of non-linear terms. For higher-order truncations, it is evident that chaotic phases can exist {cite}`Schubert2001-ea`, particularly at high *Rayleigh* numbers; what is not certain is whether, for a given degree of truncation and a given range of parameters, chaotic behaviours will manifest for a particular system. When we attempt to engage with the problem numerically and empirically through modelling, which is the purpose of this thesis, it will be seen that certain parameter bands are chaotic and time-dependent while others are not; ultimately it will be argued that such zones of chaos represent boundaries in a very high-dimensional phase space, and relate fundamentally to the nature and proper characterisation of tectonic modes."
