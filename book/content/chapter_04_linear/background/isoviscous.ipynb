    "Due to their simplicity and amenability to symbolic analysis, isoviscous models were among the earliest published mantle convection models {cite}`McKenzie1973-gt,McKenzie1974-wb,Jarvis1986-me,Blankenbach1989-li`, and they continue to be produced and discussed today {cite}`Zhong2005-lh,Weller2016-ej,Weller2016-nm,Vilella2018-il`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an isoviscous model, the viscosity function (usually set to $\\eta=1$) is constant throughouts space and time. Though simple, it is nevertheless albe to reproduce appropriate surface velocities, gravitational profiles, and even topographic wavelengths {cite}`McKenzie1973-gt,McKenzie1974-wb`. Though its parameters are few, there remain limitless possible variations through *Rayleigh* number, internal heat $H$, domain geometry, and choice of boundary condition - many of which boast long-term stability solutions with enough implicit nonlinearity to make purely analytical studies infeasible {cite}`Daly1980-xl`. And while the isoviscous model is certainly the most computationally tractable of all mantle-like rheologies, it is only in the last decade that simulations of appropriate scale for the Earth ($Ra>10^7$) have become possible {cite}`Vynnycky2013-wg,Trubitsyn2018-jo`; these have confirmed earlier intuitions that stable convective planforms may either not exist, or may never manifest, on planetary spatiotemporal scales {cite}`Huttig2011-jt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the model does bely considerable complexity, it is simple enough to make some solutions analytically attainable. Like all convecting systems, a 'critical' *Rayleigh* number $Ra_{cr}$ should exist below which convection ceases and conduction dominates (i.e. $Nu=1$), defining a 'supercritical $Ra$':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R \\equiv \\frac{Ra}{Ra_{cr}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "At $R=1$, perturbations of a certain 'critical' wavelength are uniquely able to grow faster than the conductive geotherm and hence become unstable; increasing $R$ beyond $1$ makes more wavelengths available for convective growth,  until at extreme values ($Ra >> 10^7$) even artificial heterogeneities introduced by random noise can grow, such that large-scale models become overwhelmingly time-dependent {cite}`Jarvis1984-xo`. For a plane domain of infinite horizontal extent, the critical wavelength $\\lambda_{cr}$ should be exactly $\\sqrt{2}$ {cite}`Chandrasekhar1961-ez`, corresponding to a $Ra_{cr}$ of exactly {cite}`Malkus1954-ee`:\n",

    "In any real system, however, $A$ cannot be infinite, and may be literally or effectively compressed such that the critical wavelength is no longer available. The effect of this is to create a dependency of $Ra_{cr}$ on $A$ {cite}`Chandrasekhar1961-ez`:\n",

    "If an isoviscous system does stabilise, the symmetry of the system requires that the upper and lower thermal boundaries become identical, 180-degree rotations of one another. Using Boundary Layer Theory {cite}`Olson1987-do` - the sub-analysis of arbitrarily thin layers at domain margins - a family of such stable planforms can be identified which follow a simple scaling law, mentioned previously and expounded in the textbook literature {cite}`Schubert2001-ea`:\n",

The coefficient of proportionality is theoretically $\\approx 0.1941$ {cite}`Olson1987-do`, though it has been argued that its value will tend be dominated by uncertainty in practice {cite}`Lenardic2003-wd`; reported values have ranged between $0.25-0.27$ {cite}`Olson1987-do,Jarvis1989-qj`.\n",

    "An equivalent scaling {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua` has instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Nu \\propto R^{\\beta} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R$, again, is the proportion by which $Ra$ exceeds $Ra_{cr}$. Defining $Ra$ in this way preserves the value of $\\beta$ but allows the coefficient to relate more strictly to non-thermal factors like the domain geometry, particularly the aspect ratio, which has been observed to stretch or compress the planform horizontally without changing the underlying boundary stability criteria {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, at the state where $Nu$ satisfies this scaling, the interior of each cell becomes a homogeneous region of uniform temperatures and low velocities, with strong gradients and shears at the margins, with the overall cell dimensions approaching an aspect ratio of $\\sqrt{2}$. Because of the fixed temperature scale, the only way heat transport can be enhanced is by thinning the boundary layers, which in practice occurs by dripping/pluming until only the theoretical stable boundary thickness is left. For this reason, $Nu$ also functions as a useful proxy for boundary layer thickness when this is otherwise hard to define.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical *beta* scaling is seductive because it connects the relatively well-constrained fact of surface geothermal flux with the more mysterious thermal state of the mantle, and so allows parameterised thermal histories to be projected through deep time. The $\\beta \\to \\frac{1}{3}$ limit itself ultimately derives from the *Rayleigh* number's dependence on length cubed, and while there is no *a priori* reason to believe that this analytical justification must be borne out in practice, it has been recognised as extremely suggestive for over half a century {cite}`Chan1971-xv`. Testing this scaling behaviour empirically was an early priority of computational geodynamics, with several studies producing estimates that converged on, but did not achieve, the theoretical $\\frac{1}{3}$ scaling: the value has been reported as any of $0.313$ {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua`, $0.318$ {cite}`Jarvis1986-me`, $0.319$ {cite}`Schubert1985-sy`, $0.326$ {cite}`Jarvis1989-qj`, and $0.36$ {cite}`Quareni1985-ff`, using various methods. The reason for the deviation is uncertain. It was for a time suggested that, at very high *Rayleigh* numbers, an 'asymptotic regime' of $\\beta \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ might emerge, which might help explain the apparent 'thermal catastophe' of the Early Earth {cite}`Urey1955-zs`; however, a definitive laboratory study using liquid helium {cite}`Niemela2000-cu` found that there is no such transition within $Ra<=10^7$, and reported instead an empirical value of $0.31$ for the interval $Ra: 10^6 - 10^7$, in close agreement with numerical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *beta* scaling strictly holds only for those isoviscous systems with purely basal (no volumetric) heating, Cartesian geometry, and free-slip boundaries, it has been found to hold for a wide range of systems if certain corrections are made."
