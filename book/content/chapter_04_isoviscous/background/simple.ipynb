    "Due to their relative simplicity and amenability to symbolic analysis, isoviscous models were among the earliest published mantle convection models {cite}`McKenzie1973-gt,McKenzie1974-wb,Jarvis1986-me,Blankenbach1989-li`, and they continue to be produced and discussed today {cite}`Zhong2005-lh,Weller2016-cc,Weller2016-nm,Vilella2018-il`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an isoviscous model, the viscosity function (usually set to $\\eta=1$) is constant throughout space and time. Though simple, it is nevertheless able to reproduce appropriate surface velocities, gravitational profiles, and even topographic wavelengths {cite}`McKenzie1973-gt,McKenzie1974-wb`. Though its parameters are few, there remain limitless possible variations through *Rayleigh* number, internal heat $H$, domain geometry, and choice of boundary condition - many of which boast long-term stability solutions with enough implicit nonlinearity to make purely analytical studies infeasible {cite}`Daly1980-xl`. Even within each parameter set, chaotic dynamics ensure that two nearly identical configurations may yet have wildly divergent outcomes {cite}`Stewart1989-os,Palymskiy2003-fq`. And while the isoviscous model is certainly the most computationally tractable of all mantle-like rheologies, it is only in the last decade that long-run simulations of appropriate scale for the Earth ($\\mathrm{Ra}>10^7$) have become possible {cite}`Vynnycky2013-wg,Trubitsyn2018-jo`; these have confirmed earlier intuitions that stable convective planforms may not exist, or at least may never manifest on planetary spatiotemporal scales {cite}`Huttig2011-jt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the isoviscous model does bely considerable complexity, it is simple enough to make some solutions analytically attainable. Like all convecting systems, a 'critical' *Rayleigh* number $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ should exist below which convection ceases and conduction dominates (i.e. $\\mathrm{Nu}=1$), defining a 'supercritical $\\mathrm{Ra}$':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}}{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{cr}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What occurs at any given value of $R$ is determined by the availability of a certain 'critical' wavelength of thermal perturbation. A thermal perturbation at the critical wavelength is guaranteed to grow faster than any other perturbation at any other wavelength - but there is no guarantee that even a critical perturbation such as this will grow fast enough to overcome the conductive geotherm and establish convection. At $R<1$, the conductive timescale is always quicker than the convective timescale, even for a critical perturbation. At values of $R>1$, there is always at least one perturbation wavelength that is fast enough to outstrip conduction and establish a convective geotherm. Increasing $R$ beyond $1$ makes more wavelengths available for convective growth, until at extreme values ($\\mathrm{Ra} >> 10^7$) even artificial heterogeneities introduced by random noise can grow, such that large-scale models become overwhelmingly time-dependent {cite}`Jarvis1984-xo`. Between these sub- and super-critical scenarios lies the point $R=1$, where the growth timescale of a critical perturbation is comparable to the conductive timescale, and the two thermal mechanisms are in perpetual contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, the value of the critical wavelength $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ is independent of the thermal properties of the system and, for the sorts of plane box geometries under discussion here, should theoretically be exactly $\\sqrt{2}$ {cite}`Chandrasekhar1961-ez`. Whether that wavelength is actually *available* is another question. A domain whose aspect ratio $A$ is smaller than $\\sqrt{2}$ is forced to make do with perturbations of a maximum wavelength of $A$. The effect of this is to create a dependency of $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ on $A$ such that {cite}`Malkus1954-ee`:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{cr}} = 2^3\\pi^4 \\approx 779.3 $$\n",

    "While heat may be transported by convection in the interior of the system, heat may only cross in or out of the system as a whole via conduction. This occurs across two thin layers at the outer and inner boundaries. Since we stipulate that these layers are purely conductive, a *Rayleigh* number defined only across each layer must be below the critical value for that layer: ${\\mathrm{Ra}}_{layer} < {{\\mathrm{Ra}}_{layer}}_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ `Olson1987-do`. This is the first observation of boundary layer theory, whence can be deduced the following fundamental power law relationship between the *Rayleigh* and *Nusselt* numbers {cite}`Schubert2001-ea`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{Nu} \\propto \\mathrm{Ra}^{\\beta}, \\quad \\beta \\to \\frac{1}{3} $$\n",

    "Where $\\mathrm{Nu}$ is the Nusselt number. The coefficient of proportionality is theoretically $\\approx 0.1941$ {cite}`Olson1987-do`, though it has been argued that its value will tend to be dominated by uncertainty in practice {cite}`Lenardic2003-wd`; reported values have ranged between $0.25-0.27$ {cite}`Olson1987-do,Jarvis1989-qj`.\n",

    "Where $R$, again, is the proportion by which $\\mathrm{Ra}$ exceeds $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining $\\mathrm{Ra}$ in this way preserves the value of $\\beta$ insofar as $\\mathrm{Ra}^{\\mathrm{cr}}$ is independent of it, but allows the coefficient of proportionality to relate more strictly to non-thermal factors like the domain geometry - for example the aspect ratio, which (above a certain threshold) has been observed to stretch or compress the planform horizontally without changing the underlying boundary stability criteria {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another neat implication of the $\\beta$ law is that $ \\mathrm{Nu} \\to 1 $ as $ R \\to 1 $. This is intuitive because $ \\mathrm{Nu} \\to 1 $ when convection collapses, which is just what is implied by $ R \\to 1 $. However, we do have to be careful when considering subcritical values of $\\mathrm{Ra}$, which - if the $\\beta$ scaling is taken literally - would drive $\\mathrm{Nu}$ to values below one: a sub-conductive geotherm. While a scenario like this could conceivably obtain over the short term - potentially even as a consequence of abrupt convective failure, as the scaling law suggests - it could not persist over the long term due to the relatively rapid rate of thermal diffusion relative to planetary timescales. Thus it is arguably inappropriate for a steady-state scaling law to project $\\mathrm{Nu} < 1$ in any scenario whatsoever:\n",

    "A conditional definition like this implies a piecewise function. If the relation is in fact continuous, as would be natural, the behaviour at the limit $R \\to 1$ is unclear. In practice, as we have discussed, the fate of any convecting system near this boundary will be heavily controlled by the particular distribution of hot and cold material at any given time."

    "In any case, at the state where $\\mathrm{Nu}$ satisfies the $\\beta$ law, the interior of each cell becomes a homogeneous region of uniform temperature $T^{cell}$ and variable but low velocities, with strong gradients and shears at the margins, and overall cell dimensions approaching an aspect ratio of $\\sqrt{2}$. Because of the fixed temperature scale, the only way heat transport can be enhanced in such a system is by thinning the boundary layers, which in practice occurs by dripping/pluming until only the theoretical stable boundary thickness is left. For this reason, $\\mathrm{Nu}$ also functions as a useful proxy for boundary layer thickness when this is otherwise hard to define.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical $\\beta$ scaling is seductive because it connects the relatively well-constrained fact of surface geothermal flux with the more mysterious thermal state of the mantle, and so allows parameterised thermal histories to be projected through deep time. The $\\beta \\to \\frac{1}{3}$ limit itself ultimately derives from the *Rayleigh* number's dependence on length cubed, and while there is no *a priori* reason to believe that this analytical justification must be borne out in practice, it has been recognised as extremely suggestive for over half a century {cite}`Chan1971-xv`. Testing this scaling behaviour empirically was an early priority of computational geodynamics, with several studies producing estimates that converged on, but did not achieve, the theoretical $\\frac{1}{3}$ scaling: the value has been reported as any of $0.313$ {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua`, $0.318$ {cite}`Jarvis1986-me`, $0.319$ {cite}`Schubert1985-sy`, $0.326$ {cite}`Jarvis1989-qj`, $0.36$ {cite}`Quareni1985-ff`, and $0.31$ {cite}`Niemela2000-cu`, using various methods both numerical and laboratory-based. The reason for the deviation is uncertain. One possibility is that the boundary layer instability theory is only valid in the limit $\\mathrm{Ra}\\to\\infty$ {cite}`Olson1987-do`. Alternatively, high $\\mathrm{Ra}$ values may witness transitions to alternate scaling logics altogether - perhaps lowering $\\beta$. It has even been suggested that, at very high *Rayleigh* numbers, an 'asymptotic regime' of $\\beta \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ might emerge, though nothing like this has been observed in practice {cite}`Niemela2000-cu`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the $\\beta$ scaling strictly holds only for those isoviscous systems with purely basal (no volumetric) heating, Cartesian geometry, and free-slip boundaries, it has been found to hold for a wide range of systems if certain corrections are made {cite}`Schubert2001-ea`."
