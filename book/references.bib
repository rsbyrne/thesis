abstract="Astrophysical observations reveal a large diversity of radii and
masses of exoplanets. It is important to characterize the
interiors of exoplanets to understand planetary diversity and
further determine how unique, or not, Earth is. Assessing
interior structure is challenging because there are few data and
large uncertainties. Thus, for a given exoplanet, a range of
interior structure models can satisfy available data. Typically,
interior models aim to constrain the radial structure and
composition of the core and mantle and additionally ice, ocean,
and gas layer if appropriate. Constraining the parameters of
these layers may also inform us about interior dynamics.
However, it remains challenging to constrain interior dynamics
using interior structure models because structure models are
relatively insensitive to the thermal state of a planet.
Nevertheless, elucidating interior dynamics remains a key goal
in exoplanetology due to its role in determining surface
conditions and hence habitability. Thus far, Earth-like
habitability can be excluded for super-Earths that are in close
proximity to their stars and therefore have high surface
temperatures that promote local magma oceans.",

abstract="The nearest stars provide a fundamental constraint for our
understanding of stellar physics and the Galaxy. The nearby
sample serves as an anchor where all objects can be seen and
understood with precise data. This work is triggered by the
most recent data release of the astrometric space mission
Gaia and uses its unprecedented high precision parallax
measurements to review the census of objects within 10 pc.
The first aim of this work was to compile all stars and
brown dwarfs within 10 pc observable by Gaia, and compare it
with the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars as a quality
assurance test. We complement the list to get a full 10 pc
census, including bright stars, brown dwarfs, and
exoplanets. We started our compilation from a query on all
objects with a parallax larger than 100 mas using SIMBAD. We
completed the census by adding companions, brown dwarfs with
recent parallax measurements not in SIMBAD yet, and vetted
exoplanets. The compilation combines astrometry and
photometry from the recent Gaia Early Data Release 3 with
literature magnitudes, spectral types and line-of-sight
velocities. We give a description of the astrophysical
content of the 10 pc sample. We find a multiplicity
frequency of around 28\%. Among the stars and brown dwarfs,
we estimate that around 61\% are M stars and more than half
of the M stars are within the range M3.0 V to M5.0 V. We
give an overview of the brown dwarfs and exoplanets that
should be detected in the next Gaia data releases along with
future developments. We provide a catalogue of 541 stars,
brown dwarfs, and exoplanets in 339 systems, within 10 pc
from the Sun. This list is as volume-complete as possible
from current knowledge and provides benchmark stars that can
be used, for instance, to define calibration samples and to
test the quality of the forthcoming Gaia releases. It also
has a strong outreach potential.",

abstract="Artificial Neural Networks are powerful function
approximators capable of modelling solutions to a wide
variety of problems, both supervised and unsupervised. As
their size and expressivity increases, so too does the
variance of the model, yielding a nearly ubiquitous
overfitting problem. Although mitigated by a variety of
model regularisation methods, the common cure is to seek
large amounts of training data---which is not necessarily
easily obtained---that sufficiently approximates the data
distribution of the domain we wish to test on. In contrast,
logic programming methods such as Inductive Logic
Programming offer an extremely data-efficient process by
which models can be trained to reason on symbolic domains.
However, these methods are unable to deal with the variety
of domains neural networks can be applied to: they are not
robust to noise in or mislabelling of inputs, and perhaps
more importantly, cannot be applied to non-symbolic domains
where the data is ambiguous, such as operating on raw
pixels. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Inductive
Logic framework, which can not only solve tasks which
traditional ILP systems are suited for, but shows a
robustness to noise and error in the training data which ILP
cannot cope with. Furthermore, as it is trained by
backpropagation against a likelihood objective, it can be
hybridised by connecting it with neural networks over
ambiguous data in order to be applied to domains which ILP
cannot address, while providing data efficiency and
generalisation beyond what neural networks on their own can
achieve.",

abstract="Fundamental mathematical constants such as e and $\pi$ are
ubiquitous in diverse fields of science, from abstract
mathematics and geometry to physics, biology and chemistry1,2.
Nevertheless, for centuries new mathematical formulas relating
fundamental constants have been scarce and usually discovered
sporadically3-6. Such discoveries are often considered an act of
mathematical ingenuity or profound intuition by great
mathematicians such as Gauss and Ramanujan7. Here we propose a
systematic approach that leverages algorithms to discover
mathematical formulas for fundamental constants and helps to
reveal the underlying structure of the constants. We call this
approach 'the Ramanujan Machine'. Our algorithms find dozens of
well known formulas as well as previously unknown ones, such as
continued fraction representations of $\pi$, e, Catalan's
constant, and values of the Riemann zeta function. Several
conjectures found by our algorithms were (in retrospect) simple
to prove, whereas others remain as yet unproved. We present two
algorithms that proved useful in finding conjectures: a variant
of the meet-in-the-middle algorithm and a gradient descent
optimization algorithm tailored to the recurrent structure of
continued fractions. Both algorithms are based on matching
numerical values; consequently, they conjecture formulas without
providing proofs or requiring prior knowledge of the underlying
mathematical structure, making this methodology complementary to
automated theorem proving8-13. Our approach is especially
attractive when applied to discover formulas for fundamental
constants for which no mathematical structure is known, because
it reverses the conventional usage of sequential logic in formal
proofs. Instead, our work supports a different conceptual
framework for research: computer algorithms use numerical data to
unveil mathematical structures, thus trying to replace the

Experimentation With Multiscale Lorenz 96 Systems and Transfer

author="Chattopadhyay, Ashesh and Subel, Adam and Hassanzadeh, Pedram",
abstract="Abstract To make weather and climate models computationally
affordable, small-scale processes are usually represented in
terms of the large-scale, explicitly resolved processes using
physics-based/semi-empirical parameterization schemes. Another
approach, computationally more demanding but often more
accurate, is super-parameterization (SP). SP involves
integrating the equations of small-scale processes on
high-resolution grids embedded within the low-resolution grid of
large-scale processes. Recently, studies have used machine
learning (ML) to develop data-driven parameterization (DD-P)
schemes. Here, we propose a new approach, data-driven SP
(DD-SP), in which the equations of the small-scale processes are
integrated data-drivenly (thus inexpensively) using ML methods
such as recurrent neural networks. Employing multiscale Lorenz
96 systems as the testbed, we compare the cost and accuracy (in
terms of both short-term prediction and long-term statistics) of
parameterized low-resolution (PLR) SP, DD-P, and DD-SP models.
We show that with the same computational cost, DD-SP
substantially outperforms PLR and is more accurate than DD-P,
particularly when scale separation is lacking. DD-SP is much
cheaper than SP, yet its accuracy is the same in reproducing
long-term statistics (climate prediction) and often comparable
in short-term forecasting (weather prediction). We also
investigate generalization: when models trained on data from one
system are applied to a more chaotic system, we find that models
often do not generalize, particularly when short-term prediction
accuracies are examined. However, we show that transfer
learning, which involves re-training the data-driven model with
a small amount of data from the new system, significantly
improves generalization. Potential applications of DD-SP and
transfer learning in climate/weather modeling are discussed.",

abstract="The tectonic quiescence of cratons on a tectonically active
planet has been attributed to their physical properties such as
buoyancy, viscosity, and yield strength. Previous modelling has
shown the conditions under which cratons may be stable for the
present, but cast doubt on how they survived in a more energetic
mantle of the past. Here we incorporate an endothermic phase
change at 670 km, and a depth-dependent viscosity structure
consistent with post-glacial rebound and geoid modelling, to
simulate the dynamics of cratons in an ``Earth-like'' convecting
system. We find that cratons are unconditionally stable in such
systems for plausible ranges of viscosity ratios between the root
and asthenosphere (50--150) and the root/oceanic lithosphere
yield strength ratio (5--30). Realistic mantle viscosity
structures have limited effect on the average background cratonic
stress state, but do buffer cratons from extreme stress
excursions. An endothermic phase change at 670 km introduces an
additional time-dependence into the system, with slab
breakthrough into the lower mantle associated with 2--3 fold
stress increases at the surface. Under Precambrian mantle
conditions, however, the dominant effect is not more violent
mantle avalanches, or faster mantle/plate velocities, but rather
the drastic viscosity drop which results from hotter mantle
conditions in the past. This results in a large decrease in the
cratonic stress field, and promotes craton survival under the
evolving mantle conditions of the early Earth.",

Origination, Robustness, and Continuity, or L = O · R · C. We
evaluate each of these factors using our current understanding of

circular volcano-tectonic features known as coronae may be the
clearest surface manifestations of mantle plumes and hold clues
to the global Venusian tectonic regime. Yet, the exact processes
underlying coronae formation and the reasons for their diverse
morphologies remain controversial. Here we use three-dimensional
thermomechanical numerical simulations of impingement of a
thermal mantle plume on the Venusian lithosphere to assess the
origin and diversity of large Venusian coronae. The ability of
the mantle plume to penetrate into the Venusian lithosphere
results in four main outcomes: lithospheric dripping, short-lived
subduction, embedded plume and plume underplating. During the
first three scenarios, plume penetration and spreading induce
crustal thickness variations that eventually lead to a final
topographic isostasy-driven topographic inversion from circular
trenches surrounding elevated interiors to raised rims
surrounding inner depressions, as observed on many Venusian
coronae. Different corona structures may represent not only
different styles of plume--lithosphere interactions but also
different stages in evolution. A morphological analysis of large

abstract="Understanding the divergent evolution of Venus and Earth is a
fundamental problem in planetary science. Although Venus today
has a hot, dry atmosphere, recent modeling suggests that Venus
may have had a clement surface with liquid water until less than
1 billion years ago [1]. Venus today has a nearly stagnant
lithosphere. However, Ishtar Terra``s folded mountain belts,
8-11 km high, morphologically resemble Tibet and the Himalaya
mountains on Earth and apparently require several thousand
kilometers of surface motion at some time in Venus''s past. Loss
of liquid surface water increases the coefficient of friction in
fault zones, favoring a transition from an early mobile
lithosphere to a present-day stagnant lithosphere [2].
Solar-driven climate evolution could contribute to a prolonged
epoch of water loss on Venus and may be the ultimate cause of
the divergent evolution of both the climate history and the
interior dynamics of Venus and Earth. In addition to being a
problem of first-order importance for Solar System evolution,
understanding the divergent evolution of Venus and Earth is also
important for understanding the temporal and spatial
distribution of habitable environments in the Solar System.
Understanding the evolution of Venus is also a key test for
models that interpret Earth-sized exoplanets. Testing
evolutionary hypotheses requires interpreting clues that were
left behind in both the isotopic composition of the Venus
atmosphere and in the rock record of the Venus surface. Although
several mission concepts are currently competing for possible
flights to Venus, only the Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation
of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging Plus (DAVINCI+) mission
[3] can examine both the atmospheric isotopic record and the
rock record of Venus. DAVINCI+ is therefore a compelling choice
for selection in the current NASA Discovery Program Phase A
competition. DAVINCI+ includes an atmospheric entry probe and a
carrier spacecraft (Figure 1). The probe measures atmospheric
composition using a mass spectrometer and tunable laser
spectrometer, performs descent imaging, and measures atmospheric
structure. Following completion of the probe mission, the
carrier spacecraft enters Venus orbit and images the Venus
surface in the 1 micron atmospheric window. This payload is
ideally suited for testing models of Venus evolution. Figure 1:
The DAVINCI+ entry probe studies the atmosphere while imaging
the Alpha Regio landing site. Afterward, the carrier probe
performs infrared imaging of selected targets from orbit. The
History of Water: Isotopic Record Pioneer Venus measured the D/H
value of an H2SO4 cloud droplet at ~55 km as 157$\pm$30 times
the terrestrial value, which was interpreted as the signature of
escape of water from the Venus atmosphere [4]. Terrestrial
spectroscopy produced a similar range, whereas Venus Express
measured a value up to three times larger between 70-90 km [5].
The large value relative to Earth shows that Venus lost a
substantial amount of water, but the large uncertainty and the
lack of data below the clouds makes it difficult to
quantitatively model the history of water loss [6]. DAVINCI+
will measure D/H to high precision from above the clouds down to
the surface, greatly improving our ability to interpret the
history of water loss on Venus. In addition, the abundance and
isotopic ratios of Xe and Kr, together with the Kr/Ar and Xe/Ar
ratios, which DAVINCI+ will measure with high precision, will be
instrumental in revealing whether Venus and Earth formed in the
same way and how their climates diverged. The History of Water:
Rock Record A key but poorly answered question is the extent to
which Venus has produced granitic or felsic (SiO2-rich)
volcanism. Small amounts of felsic magma can be generated by
lithospheric processes [7], but large amounts of felsic material
requires the presence of water in the melting zone [8], as in
terrestrial subduction zones. Tessera, which are regions of old,
thick, highly tectonized crust, are widely accepted as the most
likely location for felsic material on Venus. Venus Express
observations suggest that tessera in Alpha Regio has a felsic
composition [9]. DAVINCI+ will explore the presence and
distribution of felsic rock in two ways. Comparison of the
reflectivity at 1 micron and in panchromatic descent images at
the Alpha Regio landing site will test the presence of felsic
rock at patch sizes much smaller than can be observed from
orbit. Descent imaging will also explore the landing zone
geomorphology, and stereo topography will enable quantitative
modelling of faulting and folding. Orbital imaging in the 1
micron atmospheric window will test for the presence of felsic
rock in other tessera, including Tellus Regio, Fortuna Tessera,
Maxwell Montes, Ovda Regio, and Thetis Regio. Our approach is
similar to VIRTIS on Venus Express [9] but focuses on regions in
the northern hemisphere and near the equator that were not
imaged by VIRTIS. The History of Volcanism: Isotopic Record
Volcanic outgassing releases radioactive decay products such as
40Ar and 4He to the atmosphere. DAVINCI+ measurements of their
atmospheric abundance can be used to estimate volcanic
outgassing over time. 40Ar provides an integrated record of
volcanism over Venus history. Because 4He escapes from the
atmosphere to space, its atmospheric abundance constrains
geologically recent (last billion years) volcanism. Existing
measurements of 40Ar and 4He are too imprecise to strongly
constrain the volcanic history of Venus [10] but will be
measured with much greater accuracy by DAVINCI+. Because
DAVINCI+ will constrain the history of both water and volcanism
on Venus, it will provide new insights into the feedbacks that
shaped the divergent evolution of Venus and Earth. References

abstract="There are indications that Venus once possessed much more water
than today, raising the prospect that the second planet may have
long been Earth-like and thus even habitable. But when and how
this water was lost, what evidence of this water remains in the
geological record, and even whether Venus and Earth started off
with similar water inventories, are major unanswered questions.
Establishing the extent to which Venus was once a water world
will substantially improve our understanding of this enigmatic
planet and of the rules that govern Earth-size worlds in this
and other planetary systems in general. Here, we describe the
Thalassa mission concept, named for the primordial goddess of
the sea in Greek mythology. Thalassa targets a single science
goal: Determination of the extent that water has played in the
geological evolution of Venus. This concept has four science
investigations: (1) characterization of atmospheric water loss
at Venus and the nature of the Venus atmosphere's interaction
with the solar wind and plasma environment; (2) improved
determination of the atmospheric D/H ratio and noble gas
concentrations to gain insight into the outgassing of the Venus
interior; (3) a search for volcanically emitted water in the
lower atmosphere to learn whether outgassing is occurring today;
and (4) determination of the composition of tesserae, to test
whether this distinctive terrain type formed in the presence of
abundant quantities of water and might thus be analogous to
Earth's granitic continental crust. As a multi-platform mission
concept, Thalassa would address its science objectives with
instruments both above and within the Venus atmosphere. Our
concept implementation includes: (i) an orbiter that would
measure atmospheric escape mechanisms and remotely sense surface
composition at global scales (and serve as a communication relay
to Earth); (ii) an aerial platform for assessing atmospheric
composition; and (iii) a set of deployable probes to remotely
measure surface composition at a resolution far greater than
possible from above the global cloud layer or from orbit. This
approach does not require extended surface operations,
mitigating the need for high-temperature electronics and helping
to align Thalassa with the NASA New Frontiers-class mission cost
cap.",

title="Feedbacks between a non-Newtonian upper mantle, mantle viscosity

author="Semple, A G and Lenardic, A",
abstract="SUMMARY Previous studies have shown that a low viscosity upper
mantle can impact the wavelength of mantle flow and the balance
of plate driving to resisting forces. Those studies assumed that
mantle viscosity is independent of mantle flow. We explore the
potential that mantle flow is not only influenced by viscosity
but can also feedback and alter mantle viscosity structure owing
to a non-Newtonian upper-mantle rheology. Our results indicate
that the average viscosity of the upper mantle, and viscosity
variations within it, are affected by the depth to which a
non-Newtonian rheology holds. Changes in the wavelength of
mantle flow, that occur when upper-mantle viscosity drops below
a critical value, alter flow velocities which, in turn, alter
mantle viscosity. Those changes also affect flow profiles in the
mantle and the degree to which mantle flow drives the motion of
a plate analogue above it. Enhanced upper-mantle flow, due to an
increasing degree of non-Newtonian behaviour, decreases the
ratio of upper- to lower-mantle viscosity. Whole layer mantle
convection is maintained but upper- and lower-mantle flow take
on different dynamic forms: fast and concentrated upper-mantle
flow; slow and diffuse lower-mantle flow. Collectively, mantle
viscosity, mantle flow wavelengths, upper- to lower-mantle
velocities and the degree to which the mantle can drive plate
motions become connected to one another through coupled feedback
loops. Under this view of mantle dynamics, depth-variable mantle
viscosity is an emergent flow feature that both affects and is
affected by the configuration of mantle and plate flow.",

temperature‐dependent mantle water storage capacity model",
author="Dong, Junjie and Fischer, Rebecca A and Stixrude, Lars P and
Lithgow‐Bertelloni, Carolina R",
abstract="Abstract The water content in Earth's mantle today remains
poorly constrained, but the bulk water storage capacity in the
solid mantle can be quantified based on experimental data and
may amount to a few times the modern surface ocean mass (OM). An
appreciation of the mantle water storage capacity is
indispensable to our understanding of how water may have cycled
between the surface and mantle reservoirs and changed the volume
of the oceans through time. In this study, we parameterized high
pressure-temperature experimental data on water storage
capacities in major rock-forming minerals to track the bulk
water storage capacity in Earth's solid mantle as a function of
temperature. We find that the mantle water storage capacity
decreases as mantle potential temperature (Tp) increases, and
its estimated value depends on the water storage capacity of
bridgmanite in the lower mantle: 1.86?4.41 OM with a median of
2.29 OM for today (Tp = 1600 K), and 0.52?1.69 OM with a median
of 0.72 OM for the early Earth's solid mantle (for a Tp that was
300 K higher). An increase in Tp by 200?300 K results in a
decrease in the mantle water storage capacity by 1.19?0.16+0.9
?1.56?0.22+1.1 OM. We explored how the volume of early oceans
may have controlled sea level during the early Archean (4?3.2
Ga) with some additional assumptions about early continents. We
found that more voluminous surface oceans might have existed if
the actual mantle water content today is > 0.3?0.8 OM and the
early Archean Tp was $\geq$1900 K.",

author="Hahn, Oliver and Abel, Tom",
abstract="We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial
conditions with multiple levels of refinements for
cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulations. The method uses an
adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real
space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive
multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and
velocities following first (1LPT) or second order Lagrangian
perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves RMS
relative errors of order 10^(-4) for displacements and
velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in
terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over
previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at
coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space
induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid
and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced
which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional
approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy
cluster halo our real space based approach is found to
reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo
properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level
accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for
two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and
demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in
excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For
initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the
local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a
density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with
Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current
practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.",

author="Hammond, Mark and Lewis, Neil T",
abstract="Tidally locked exoplanets likely host global atmospheric
circulations with a superrotating equatorial jet,
planetary-scale stationary waves and thermally-driven
overturning circulation. In this work, we show that each of
these features can be separated from the total circulation
by using a Helmholtz decomposition, which splits the
circulation into rotational (divergence free) and divergent
(vorticity free) components. This technique is applied to
the simulated circulation of a terrestrial planet and a
gaseous hot Jupiter. For both planets, the rotational
component comprises the equatorial jet and stationary waves,
and the divergent component contains the overturning
circulation. Separating out each component allows us to
evaluate their spatial structure and relative contribution
to the total flow. In contrast with previous work, we show
that divergent velocities are not negligible when compared
with rotational velocities, and that divergent, overturning
circulation takes the form of a single, roughly isotropic
cell that ascends on the day-side and descends on the
night-side. These conclusions are drawn for both the
terrestrial case and the hot Jupiter. To illustrate the
utility of the Helmholtz decomposition for studying
atmospheric processes, we compute the contribution of each
of the circulation components to heat transport from day- to
night-side. Surprisingly, we find that the divergent
circulation dominates day-night heat transport in the
terrestrial case and accounts for around half of the heat
transport for the hot Jupiter. The relative contributions of
the rotational and divergent components to day-night heat
transport are likely sensitive to multiple planetary
parameters and atmospheric processes, and merit further

title="The structure, rheology, and rupture mechanics of seismogenic
faulting in continental lithosphere",
author="Yang, Haibin",
abstract="This thesis explores relationships between the structure,
rheology, and rupture properties of seismogenic faulting in
continental lithosphere from four different perspectives. First,
I derive a scaling relationship that links the spacing between
two nearly parallel strike-slip faults to the frictional
strength, fault width, and lower crust viscosity for strike-slip
shear zones. Based on the scaling law, I estimate a possible
range of lower crust viscosity in the San Andreas Fault system
(California), the Marlborough Fault Zone (New Zealand) and
central Tibet (China). Second, using numerical modelling methods,
I explore how lower crust rheology contrast may affect the
long-term evolution of a major plate boundary fault. The case
study is based on the San Andreas Fault, which is found to vary
dipping angles (~50-90 degree) along strike. The moderately
dipping strike-slip fault is not consistent with Anderson
faulting theory. This inconsistency may be reconciled if there
are lateral variations in the lower crustal rheology across the
fault plane that decrease fault dip with time. Third, in addition
to strike-slip faults in active tectonic settings, my study also
includes reverse faults in stable cratonic regions, especially
for the cratonic areas of western and southern Australia. I apply
statistical methods to investigate the co-seismic slip
distribution of 11 surface-rupturing earthquakes in Australian
stable regions and provide a link between the shape and
characteristics of co-seismic slip distributions and the
geophysical properties of the host crust. Fourth, using a
comprehensive geophysical survey with the co-located 13GA-EG1 and
12GA-AF3 seismic reflection profiles and magnetotelluric profiles
and regional gravity and magnetic maps in the Nullarbor Plain
(Australia), I find that faults initiated back to the Proterozoic
could still be reactivated in a Cenozoic convergent setting,
especially for those major faults cutting to deep crust. Those
deep-penetrating faults at terrane boundaries could be a
potential channel for fluids to pass through, and thus further
weakened by the fluids, which is revealed by high-conductivity
anomaly in magnetotelluric profiles. The last research chapter of
this thesis addresses a technical issue in the particle-in-cell
finite element method, which is widely used in geodynamic
numerical modelling. As mixing materials with contrasting
viscosity within one element results in stress fluctuations, I
assess different smoothing methods to reduce the spurious stress
in mixed-material elements.",

recycling. Tessera regions that cover approximately 10\% of
Venus' surface appear to be strongly deformed, which suggests
that they have survived at least the latest resurfacing event,
although the composition and age of the tesserae are unknown.
Based on mantle convection modeling, we studied the effects of
anomalous crustal provinces (ACPs) on mantle dynamics and
postoverturn lithospheric survival. As a hypothesis, we assume
ACPs to be thick, compositionally anomalous, and rheologically
strong units, similar to terrestrial cratons. We model Venus
with a varying number of preimposed ACP units and differing
lithospheric yield stress in 2-D and 3-D spherical geometry. The
impact of ACPs on mantle dynamics and the survival of
lithosphere is investigated by examining the thermal evolution,
crustal thickness, and surface age distribution. We find that
the number and timing of overturns are highly dependent on the
yield stress and, to some degree, on the number and size of the
preimposed ACPs. ACPs in particular affect the wavelength of
convection and may foster the survival of lithosphere even of
those portions not being part of an ACP. However, ACPs do not
seem to be a good analog for tessera regions due to their
exaggerated age and (likely) thickness, but?with appropriate
density contrast?may be more useful representatives of Venus'
highland plateaus.",

surface",
author="Uppalapati, S and Rolf, T and Crameri, F and Werner, S C",
abstract="Abstract Venus is currently characterized by stagnant-lid mantle
convection, but could have previously experienced episodes of
global resurfacing due to lithospheric overturn. Using numerical
models of Venus's interior, we attempt to explain Venus's
surface characteristics in the context of interior evolution and
to understand how Venus's tectonic history has diverged from
Earth's. For both the stagnant- and the episodic-lid regime, we
explore the role of reference mantle viscosity; for the latter
regime, we also explore the role of the lithospheric yield
stress. Our stagnant-lid models predict thicker crust and
younger surface than typically inferred from cratering
statistics. When considering resurfacing episodes, the yield
stress influences the frequency of overturns, which limits
crustal thickness to better agree with previous independent
estimates. Surface age is variable and depends on overturn
frequency and resurfacing rate between overturns but reaches
larger values just before an upcoming overturn event compared to
values in the stagnant-lid cases. Both regimes predict
substantial lateral variations in surface age, instead of an
end-member uniform surface age indicating the cessation time of
the last overturn, because ongoing volcanic resurfacing is
spatially heterogeneous and dominates over tectonic resurfacing.
Reviewing the crater-based surface age variations suggests that
the model-predicted age spreads in the episodic scenario could
be consistent with Venus's cratering record. Moreover, we find
that a small fraction of crust can resist recycling during
overturns. These outcomes indicate that overturn events may
allow for surface age variations that reproduce Venus's surface
better than stagnant-lid models.",

title="The physics of changing tectonic regimes: Implications for the
temporal evolution of mantle convection and the thermal history
of Venus",
author="Weller, Matthew B and Kiefer, Walter S",
abstract="Abstract Given similar sizes and compositions, Venus invites
comparisons with Earth. While Earth convects in the plate
tectonic regime, Venus' current and past tectonic states remain
uncertain. Venus' impact crater distribution has led to
competing models for its tectonic state, steady (e.g., stagnant
lid) or catastrophic (e.g., episodic lid). Terrestrial
geochemical evidence and geodynamic models suggest that planets
may transition between tectonic states over time. Transitions
can be triggered by increasing yield stress due to loss of water
or by increasing surface temperature. Here, we revisit the
classic endmember models of Venusian tectonics by modeling the
transition from stable mobile lid convection into a stable
stagnant lid in 3D spherical geometry. Transitions between
states are governed by both regional and global scale
instabilities, resulting in oscillations in heat flux, velocity,
and magma production over Gyr time scales. The thermal and
tectonic evolution of a convectively transitioning planet is
neither catastrophic nor steady. Volcanism and tectonic yielding
may be non-global in nature. At any given time, portions of the
planetary surface may reflect apparently different styles of
convection, with some regions being highly active and other
regions being sluggish and inactive. For Venus, the implications
are that global melt production and resurfacing are a natural
consequence of lid-state evolution, without needing ad hoc
resurfacing mechanisms which rely on a single governing
lid-state. Geologic evidence suggests that the transition from
mobile lid to stagnant lid is still on-going. Venus may have
lost liquid surface water in the last third of its history.",

abstract="A long-term goal of exoplanet studies is the identification and
detection of biosignature gases. Beyond the most discussed
biosignature gas O2, only a handful of gases have been considered
in detail. In this study, we evaluate phosphine (PH3). On Earth,
PH3 is associated with anaerobic ecosystems, and as such, it is a
potential biosignature gas in anoxic exoplanets. We simulate the
atmospheres of habitable terrestrial planets with CO2- and
H2-dominated atmospheres and find that PH3 can accumulate to
detectable concentrations on planets with surface production
fluxes of 1010 to 1014 cm-2 s-1 (corresponding to surface
concentrations of 10s of ppb to 100s of ppm), depending on
atmospheric composition and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. While
high, the surface flux values are comparable to the global
terrestrial production rate of methane or CH4 (1011 cm-2 s-1) and
below the maximum local terrestrial PH3 production rate (1014
cm-2 s-1). As with other gases, PH3 can more readily accumulate
on low-UV planets, for example, planets orbiting quiet M dwarfs
or with a photochemically generated UV shield. PH3 has three
strong spectral features such that in any atmosphere scenario one
of the three will be unique compared with other dominant
spectroscopic molecules. Phosphine's weakness as a biosignature
gas is its high reactivity, requiring high outgassing rates for
detectability. We calculate that tens of hours of JWST (James
Webb Space Telescope) time are required for a potential detection
of PH3. Yet, because PH3 is spectrally active in the same
wavelength regions as other atmospherically important molecules
(such as H2O and CH4), searches for PH3 can be carried out at no
additional observational cost to searches for other molecular
species relevant to characterizing exoplanet habitability.
Phosphine is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known
abiotic false positives on terrestrial planets from any source
that could generate the high fluxes required for detection.",

{3-D} models of slab rollback",

May, D",
abstract="Subduction of tectonic plates limited in lateral extent and with
a free-trailing tail, i.e., ?free subduction,? is modeled in a
three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. The models use a nonlinear
viscoplastic rheology for the subducting plate and exhibit a wide
range of behaviors depending on such plate characteristics as
strength, width, and thickness. We investigate the time evolution
of this progressive rollback subduction, measure the accompanying
return flow in the upper mantle, and quantify the plate
kinematics. Due to the 3-D geometry, flow is allowed to accompany
slab rollback around the lateral edges of the slab (the toroidal
component), as opposed to 2-D geometry, where material is forced
to flow underneath the slab tip (the poloidal component). A
simple force balance is provided which relates the speed of
backward trench migration to the resistive forces of generating
flow and weakening the plate. Our results indicate most of the
gravitational energy of the system (i.e., the negative buoyancy
of the subducting slab) is converted into a toroidal flow
(?69\%), a much smaller amount goes into weakening the plate
(?18\%), and the remaining amount goes into driving flow parallel
to displacement of the slab (?13\%). For the trench widths (W) we
investigate ($\leq$1500 km), a maximum trench retreat rate occurs
for trenches 600 km wide, which is attributed to the interaction
between a plate of finite width and the induced flow (which has a
lengthscale in the horizontal direction). These numerical results
quantitatively agree with comparable 3-D laboratory experiments
using analogue models with a purely viscous plate material
(Schellart, 2004a, 2004b), including correlations between
increasing retreat rate with increasing plate thickness, trench
width for maximum retreat rate (500 km), and estimated amount of
slab buoyancy used to drive rollback-induced flow (?70\%).
Several implications for plate tectonics on Earth result from
these models such as rollback subduction providing a physical
mechanism for ephemeral slab graveyards situated above the more
viscous lower mantle (and endothermic phase transition) prior to
a flushing event into the lower mantle (mantle avalanche).",

w(xi) for Gauss--Legendre quadrature. The eigensystem method
computes the points as the eigenvalues of a symmetric
tridiagonal matrix, and the weights are computed from its
eigenvectors. The resulting error is O(n) for the points and
$O(n^2)$ for the weights. Using an inverse Taylor series
computation for the points, Yakimiw [J. Comput. Phys., 129
(1996), pp. 406--430] reduced the point error growth to O(1). He
also reduced the error in the weights to O(n) and obtained
uniform pointwise relative accuracy. However, the points xi
cluster quadratically near the end points $x = \pm 1$, where for
some n = nmax they coalesce or even exchange to within machine
accuracy, and computation fails. Although this has not been a
problem in the past, it could soon become so because weather
models are now approaching resolutions with n > 1000. Here we
compare these methods to the Fourier--Newton method, which
consists of Newton's method for computing the transformed points
$\theta_i = \arccos x_i$ as the zeros of the Fourier
representations of the Legendre polynomials $P_n(\theta)$. The
$\theta_i$ are near equally spaced, particularly in the
neighborhood of x = 0. For a fixed arithmetic precision, this

abstract="In this paper, we validate three-dimensional numerical models of
subduction against a laboratory experiment. The design of our
numerical models follows that of the laboratory, and employs a
single subducting plate fixed at its trailing edge without an
overriding plate. Rheology and buoyancy are not thermally
dependent, but importantly the model has a free surface boundary.
All the models include a sticky air layer, which is an
approximation to a free surface boundary condition, as opposed to
a free-slip condition that unrealistically binds the plate to the
upper surface. We use a parallel, Python, particle-in-cell,
finite-element scheme, and present 8 different models that differ
in their viscosity at the interfaces of the subducting plate. We
consider harmonic and arithmetic averaging of the viscosity
together with a plate composite rheology associated with
arithmetic averaging, which similarly to the harmonic averaging
results in two lubricated sub-layers at the plate lower and upper
interfaces. Despite showing a similar subduction-induced poloidal
and toroidal flow in the mantle, the agreement of the models with
the experiment is overall ordinary. The rates at which the slab
tip sinks and the plate hinge retreats are approaching the
laboratory counterparts to within 7--18\%, at best, when using
the composite plate models. Errors in the characterization of the
laboratory parameters can account for 5\% of such differences. As
the composite plate sub-layers are made stiffer, the plate hinge
also begins to depart from the steady retreat observed in the
laboratory experiment. All numerical models exhibit a secondary
Rayleigh-Taylor instability along the plate edge that is not
observed in the laboratory experiment. The development of this
instability is further delayed when the numerical spatial
resolution is increased, or when the composite plate sub-layers
are made stiffer. This benchmark exercise shows that 1) the
glucose surface tension in the laboratory, not taken into account
in the numerical modelling, is sufficient to prevent the flank
instability during the retreat, and 2) numerical models are
usually free from it due to their use of stiffer plate sub-layers
and/or their display of a limited amount of retreat compared to
this study.",

abstract="Abstract We introduce and describe a new software infrastructure
TerraFERMA, the Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler,
for the rapid and reproducible description and solution of
coupled multiphysics problems. The design of TerraFERMA is driven
by two computational needs in Earth sciences. The first is the
need for increased flexibility in both problem description and
solution strategies for coupled problems where small changes in
model assumptions can lead to dramatic changes in physical
behavior. The second is the need for software and models that are
more transparent so that results can be verified, reproduced, and
modified in a manner such that the best ideas in computation and
Earth science can be more easily shared and reused. TerraFERMA
leverages three advanced open-source libraries for scientific
computation that provide high-level problem description (FEniCS),
composable solvers for coupled multiphysics problems (PETSc), and
an options handling system (SPuD) that allows the hierarchical
management of all model options. TerraFERMA integrates these
libraries into an interface that organizes the scientific and
computational choices required in a model into a single options
file from which a custom compiled application is generated and
run. Because all models share the same infrastructure, models
become more reusable and reproducible, while still permitting the
individual researcher considerable latitude in model
construction. TerraFERMA solves partial differential equations
using the finite element method. It is particularly well suited

abstract="The numerical solution of a discrete Stokes flow problem is a
common component of many computational geodynamic models. We
compare using the Schur complement reduction (SCR) and a fully
coupled (FC) approach to solve geodynamic problems which are
characterized by incompressible fluids containing large
variations in viscosity. The scalability and robustness of these
methods is assessed by examining their sensitivity to the
discretization parameter h and the viscosity contrast
$\Delta$$\eta$, respectively. We demonstrate that the scaled
BFBt preconditioner [Elman, H.C., Howle, V.E., Shadid, J.,
Shuttleworth, R., Tuminaro, R., 2006. Block preconditioners

even when the fluid viscosity varies in space, provided an
appropriate scaling is used. The performance of this
preconditioner is strongly linked to the scaling employed.
Through a number of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
our new scaling strategy ensures that the scaled BFBt
preconditioner remains effective in scenarios where the
viscosity variations are either locally smooth or discontinuous.
Of the solvers considered, applying FGMRES to the pressure Schur
complement in combination with BFBt and our choice of scaling
matrices was the most scalable and robust approach.",

Theory",

abstract="A theoretical study has been made of an experiment by Tritton \&
Zarraga (1967) in which eonvective motions were generated in a
horizontal layer of water (cooled from above) by the application
of uniform heating. The marginal stability problem for such a
layer is solved, and a critical Rayleigh number of 2772 is
obtained, at which patterns of wave-number 2·63 times the
reciprocal depth of the layer are marginally stable.The
remainder of the paper is devoted to the finite amplitude
convection which ensues when the Rayleigh number, R, exceeds
2772. The theory is approximate, the basic simplification being
that, to an adequate approximation, Fourier decompositions of
the convective motions in the horizontal (x, y) directions can
be represented by their dominant (planform) terms alone. A
discussion is given of this hypothesis, with illustrations drawn
from the (better studied) B{\'e}nard situation of convection in
a layer heated below, cooled from above, and containing no heat
sources. The hypothesis is then used to obtain `mean-field
equations' for the convection. These admit solutions of at least
three distinct forms: rolls, hexagons with upward flow at their
centres, and hexagons with downward flow at their centres. Using
the hypothesis again, the stability of these three solutions is
examined. It is shown that, for all R, a (neutrally) stable form
of convection exists in the form of rolls. The wave-number of
this pattern increases gradually with R. This solution is, in
all respects, independent of Prandtl number. It is found,
numerically, that the hexagons with upward motions in their
centres are unstable, but that the hexagons with downward
motions at their centres are completely stable, provided R
exceeds a critical value (which depends on Prandtl number, P,
and which for water is about 3Rc), and provided the wave-number

abstract="Whether in the mantle or in magma chambers, convective flows are
characterized by large variations of viscosity. We study the
influence of the viscosity structure on the development of
convective instabilities in a viscous fluid which is cooled from
above. The upper and lower boundaries of the fluid are
stress-free. A viscosity dependence with depth of the form $\nu$0
+ $\nu$1 exp(−$\gamma$.z) is assumed. After the temperature of
the top boundary is lowered, velocity and temperature
perturbations are followed numerically until convective breakdown
occurs. Viscosity contrasts of up to 107 and Rayleigh numbers of
up to 108 are studied. For intermediate viscosity contrasts
(around 103), convective breakdown is characterized by the almost
simultaneous appearance of two modes of instability. One involves
the whole fluid layer, has a large horizontal wavelength (several
times the layer depth) and exhibits plate-like behaviour. The
other mode has a much smaller wavelength and develops below a
rigid lid. The ``whole layer'' mode dominates for small viscosity
contrasts but is suppressed by viscous dissipation at large
viscosity contrasts. For the ``rigid lid'' mode, we emphasize
that it is the form of the viscosity variation which determines
the instability. For steep viscosity profiles, convective flow
does not penetrate deeply in the viscous region and only weak
convection develops. We propose a simple method to define the
rigid lid thickness. We are thus able to compute the true depth
extent and the effective driving temperature difference of
convective flow. Because viscosity contrasts in the convecting
region do not exceed 100, simple scaling arguments are sufficient
to describe the instability. The critical wavelength is
proportional to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer below
the rigid lid. Convection occurs when a Rayleigh number defined
locally exceeds a critical value of 160--200. Finally, we show
that a local Rayleigh number can be computed at any depth in the
fluid and that convection develops below depth zr (the rigid lid
thickness) such that this number is maximum. The simple
similarity laws are applied to the upper mantle beneath oceans

abstract="The heat transport scaling relationships for fluids heated from
within and below are established based on numerical calculations
of isoviscous Boussinesq convection at infinite Prandtl number.
The internal temperatures scale in a way that is similar to the
internally heated case but with an offset equal to the average of
the two boundary temperatures, reflecting the underlying
temperature structure of bottom-heated convection. The heat
fluxes through the boundaries scale as a linear combination of
the end-member modes of heat transport, consistent with the
effects of internal heating on the interior temperature. The
boundary layer thicknesses, however, depend on H and Ra in a
nonintuitive way. As the internal temperature increases with the
addition of internal heating, the upper thermal boundary layer
thickens despite the increased temperature drop across the layer
(the reverse is true for the bottom boundary layer). This is
inconsistent with the idea that the boundary layer thickness is
controlled by a stability condition on the local Rayleigh number,
which would predict that the boundary layer would thin as the
temperature drop increases. Deriving boundary layer thicknesses
from the scalings for heat flux and boundary layer temperature
drop provides an excellent fit to the model results and reveals
the importance of plumes arriving from the other boundary layer
in establishing the boundary layer thickness. This suggests that,
although widely used, boundary layer stability analysis is not an
accurate description of the processes controlling boundary layer

title="Effects of strongly variable viscosity on three-dimensional
compressible convection in planetary mantles",
author="Tackley, Paul J",
abstract="A systematic investigation into the effects of temperature
dependent viscosity on three-dimensional compressible mantle
convection has been performed by means of numerical simulations
in Cartesian geometry using a finite volume multigrid code, with
a factor of 1000?2500 viscosity variation, Rayleigh numbers
ranging from 105?107, and stress-free upper and lower boundaries.
Considerable differences in model behavior are found depending on
the details of rheology, heating mode, compressibility, and
boundary conditions. Parameter choices were guided by realistic
Earth models. In Boussinesq, basally heated cases with viscosity
solely dependent on temperature and stress-free, isothermal
boundaries, very long wavelength flows (?25,000 km, assuming the
depth corresponds to mantle thickness) with cold plumes and hot
upwelling sheets result, in contrast to the upwelling plumes and
downwelling sheets found in small domains, illustrating the
importance of simulating wide domains. The addition of depth
dependence results in small cells and reverses the planform,
causing hot plumes and cold sheets. The planform of
temperature-dependent viscosity convection is due predominantly
to vertical variations in viscosity resulting from the
temperature dependence. Compressibility, with associated
depth-dependent properties, results in a tendency for broad
upwelling plumes and narrow downwelling sheets, with large aspect
ratio cells. Perhaps the greatest modulation effect occurs in
internally heated compressible cases, in which the
short-wavelength pattern of time-dependent cold plumes commonly
observed in constant-viscosity calculations completely changes
into a very long wavelength pattern of downwelling sheets (spaced
up to 24,000 km apart) with time-dependent plumelike
instabilities. These results are particularly interesting, since
the basal heat flow in the Earth's mantle is usually thought to
be very low, e.g., 5?20\% of total. The effects of viscous
dissipation and adiabatic heating play only a minor role in the
overall heat budget for constant-viscosity cases, an observation
which is not much affected by the Rayleigh number. However,
viscous dissipation becomes important in the stiff upper boundary
layer when viscosity is temperature dependent. This effect is
caused by the very high stresses occurring in this stiff lid,
typically 2 orders of magnitude higher than the stresses in the
interior of the domain for the viscosity contrast modeled here.
The temperature in the interior of convective cells is highly
sensitive to the material properties, with temperature-dependent
viscosity and depth-dependent thermal conductivity strongly
increasing the internal temperature, and depth-dependent
viscosity strongly decreasing it. The sensitivity of the observed
flow pattern to these various complexities clearly illustrates
the importance of performing compressible, variable-viscosity
mantle convection calculations with rheological and thermodynamic
properties matching as closely as possible those of the Earth.",

abstract="Chemical and physical Earth models agree little as to the
radioactive power of the planet. Each predicts a range of
radioactive powers, overlapping slightly with the other at about
24 TW, and together spanning 14?46 TW. Approximately 20\% of this
radioactive power (3?8 TW) escapes to space in the form of
geoneutrinos. The remaining 11?38 TW heats the planet with
significant geodynamical consequences, appearing as the
radiogenic component of the 43?49 TW surface heat flow. The
nonradiogenic component of the surface heat flow (5?38 TW) is
presumably primordial, a legacy of the formation and early
evolution of the planet. A constraining measurement of radiogenic
heating provides insights to the thermal history of the Earth and
potentially discriminates chemical and physical Earth models.
Radiogenic heating in the planet primarily springs from unstable
nuclides of uranium, thorium, and potassium. The paths to their
stable daughter nuclides include nuclear beta decays, producing
geoneutrinos. Large subsurface detectors efficiently record the
energy but not the direction of the infrequent interactions of
the highest-energy geoneutrinos, originating only from uranium
and thorium. The measured energy spectrum of the interactions
estimates the relative amounts of these heat-producing elements,
while the intensity estimates planetary radiogenic power. Recent
geoneutrino observations in Japan and Italy find consistent
values of radiogenic heating. The combined result mildly excludes
the lowest model values of radiogenic heating and, assuming whole
mantle convection, identifies primordial heat loss. Future
observations have the potential to measure radiogenic heating
with better precision, further constraining geological models and
the thermal evolution of the Earth. This review presents the

abstract="Several defective assumptions have hindered understanding the
evolution of Earth and its nearest neighbors. These include the
claim that the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systems can uniquely
define oceanic rocks, acceptance of the ``CHondritic Uniform
Reservoir'' (CHUR) model and a steadily depleting but fertile
mantle, and belief that Proterozoic rocks exhibit features
resembling those of Phanerozoic plate tectonics. Earth's Archean
was the era of internally mobile crust. In the period ~4.0--2.5
b.y. tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) crust formed by
hydrous partial melting of a mafic protocrust leaving dense,
depleted, garnet-rich residue. This delaminated and sank to at
least 200 km beginning top-down re-enrichment of the mantle. The
remaining stabilized TTG crust was then directly underlain by
primordial low-density dunitic shallow mantle. Archean crust is
granite and greenstone with no modern analogue. During the
Proterozoic basins of volcanic and terrigenous sedimentary rocks
formed on and between Archean shields. Where these basins
thickened to ~40 km their deep regions partly melted by their own
radioactivity and they were ``inverted'' by materials rich in
highly evolved hydrous granites rising to mid-crustal level. This
hydrous melting was enabled by a bombardment of icy bolides.
Proterozoic dynamics were driven by vertical variations in
density, reflect primarily the deposition and collapse of basins,
and involved small horizontal motions only. Proterozoic
paleomagnetic data cast doubt on the existence of a strong
dipolar magnetic field at that time and there is no compelling
evidence for Phanerozoic-like plate tectonics. Only near the end
of the Proterozoic did downward recycling of fusible components
enable a weak asthenosphere to develop over which lithospheric
plates could slide. The Phanerozoic is the era of plate
tectonics. Lithosphere motions are well documented by
palaeomagnetism which suggests Earth's internal strong dipolar
magnetic field may have developed at ~600 m.y. Organic evolution
may have been enabled by these geodynamic changes. The Cambrian
explosion of evolution produced almost all phyla of modern
animals within about 50 m.y., possibly because the newly-formed
strong dipolar magnetic field provided a shield against ionized
radiation. Multidisciplinary evidence indicates that Earth, Mars,
Venus and the Moon thoroughly fractionated early---by 4.5--4.4
b.y.---to form cores, refractory mantles and thick mafic crusts.
All were bombarded by bolides that saturated their surfaces with
impact craters and pools of impact-melted mafic protocrust that
fractionated into layered igneous complexes. Venus, Mars and the
Moon retain their heavily impacted surfaces. Their upper mantles
have been solid and strong subsequently, they lack asthenospheres
and liquid cores, and cannot sustain plate tectonics or mantle
plumes. Variants of plume theory have been inappropriately
exported to Venus and Mars to explain circular features and
volcanism. Martian ``volcanoes'' and Venusian ``tessera
plateaus'' are impact-melt products. A long-lasting global magma
ocean on the Moon is falsified by petrology and the preservation
of extremely ancient landscapes. Volatiles were delivered to
Earth, the Moon, Mars, and Venus in a barrage of icy bolides
starting at ~4.0--3.9 b.y. which probably formed Earth's oceans
and atmosphere. Oceans and their remnants survived for 2--3 b.y.
on Venus and ~1 b.y. on Mars. Melts on the Moon were
water-enriched for perhaps 1 b.y. and there may have been ancient
transient liquid water there also. Only Earth was internally hot
and active enough to circulate the volatiles downward enabling
hydrous melting, slow re-enrichment of the upper mantle and, at
~600 m.y., plate tectonics and rapid biological evolution.",

author="Weller, M B and Lenardic, A",
abstract="We use simulations of mantle convection with surface yielding to
show that multiple tectonic regimes are possible for equivalent
system parameter values. Models with the same lithospheric
strength parameters and the same vigor of convection can display
different modes of tectonics. Within the region of multiple
solutions, the evolutionary pathway of the system is the dominant
factor that determines the tectonic mode (e.g., whether mantle
convection operates in a plate tectonic like mode). The extent of
the multiple regimes window is found to increase with the
temperature-dependent viscosity contrast across the system. The
implication for models that seek to predict the tectonic regimes
of planets is that the temporal evolution of the planet needs to
be taken into account. A further implication is that modeling
studies can lead to different conclusions regarding the tectonic
state of a planet, extra-solar planets in particular, despite the
final model parameter values remaining equivalent.",

author="Moore, W B and Lenardic, A",
abstract="Abstract Consideration of the structure of dynamical equilibria
in terrestrial planets using simplified descriptions of the
relevant heat transport processes (rigid-lid convection, plate
tectonics, and heat pipe volcanism) reveals that if the
efficiency of plate tectonic heat transport decreases at higher
mantle temperature, then it cannot govern quasi-equilibrium
dynamical evolution, and the system is always evolving away from
the plate tectonic regime. A planet on which plate tectonics is
less efficient at higher temperature stays in heat pipe mode
longer, spends less time undergoing plate tectonics, and has a
low and ever-decreasing Urey number during this phase. These
conclusions are based solely on the structure of the equilibria
in a system with less efficient plate tectonics in the past and
are independent of the mechanisms leading to this behavior.
Commonly used quasi-equilibrium approaches to planetary thermal
evolution are likely not valid for planets in which heat
transport becomes less efficient at higher temperature.",

author="O'Neill, C and Marchi, S and Zhang, S and Bottke, W",
abstract="Impact cratering was a dominant geologic process in the early
Solar System that probably played an active role in the crustal
evolution of the young terrestrial planets. The Earth's interior
during the Hadean, 4.56 to 4 billion years ago, may have been
too hot to sustain plate tectonics. However, whether large
impacts could have triggered tectonism on the early Earth
remains unclear. Here we conduct global-scale tectonic
simulations of the evolution of the Earth through the Hadean eon
under variable impact fluxes. Our simulations show that the
thermal anomalies produced by large impacts induce mantle
upwellings that are capable of driving transient subduction
events. Furthermore, we find that moderate-sized impacts can act
as subduction triggers by causing localized lithospheric
thinning and mantle upwelling, and modulate tectonic activity.
In contrast to contemporary subduction, the simulated localized
subduction events are relatively short-lived (less than 10 Myr)
with relatively thin, weak plates. We suggest that resurgence in
subduction activity induced by an increased impact flux between
4.1 and 4.0 billion years ago may explain the coincident
increase in palaeointensity of the magnetic field. We further
suggest that transient impact-driven subduction reconciles
evidence from Hadean zircons for tectonic activity with other
lines of evidence consistent with an Earth that was largely
tectonically stagnant from the Hadean into the Archaean.",

2--4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not
required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are
surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper

hydrothermal circulation in young oceanic crust by utilising a
half-space cooling approximation. For the rest of Earth's
surface, we estimate the average heat flow for different
geologic domains as defined by global digital geology maps; and
then produce the global estimate by multiplying it by the total
global area of that geologic domain. The averaging is done on a
polygon set which results from an intersection of a 1 degree
equal area grid with the original geology polygons; this
minimises the adverse influence of clustering. These operations
and estimates are derived accurately using methodologies from
Geographical Information Science. We consider the virtually
un-sampled Antarctica separately and also make a small
correction for hot-spots in young oceanic lithosphere. A range
of analyses is presented. These, combined with statistical
estimates of the error, provide a measure of robustness. Our

abstract="Previous interpretations of the Pioneer Venus mass spectrometer
data of the deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratio of 1.9$\times$10-2
or 120$\pm$40 times the terrestrial value indicate that Venus
may have had at least an H2O content of the order of about 0.3\%
of a terrestrial ocean (TO), and even much more during and
shortly after the accretion period of ⩽300Myr, depending on the
unknown ratio of a continuous supply of H2O by comets to a
hydrogen blow-off loss and impact erosion of the early
atmosphere. In view of the low H2O abundance in the present
atmosphere, several studies suggest that the planet should have
lost most of its H2O during the early high X-ray, EUV and solar
wind period of the active young Sun. Because oxygen did not
accumulate in Venus' atmosphere it is commonly believed that a
part of the oxygen from dissociated H2O vapor was dragged off to
space along with the escaping hydrogen during a blow-off period,
or could have oxidized the surface minerals to produce FeO and
Fe2O3 to the depths of a few kilometers to tens of kilometers
depending on the initial amount of H2O. We use in the present
study, for the first time, multi-wavelength X-ray and EUV (XUV)
observations by the ASCA, ROSAT, EUVE, FUSE and IUE satellites
and stellar winds inferred from mass loss observations by the
Hubble Space Telescope of solar proxies with ages <4.6Gyr for
the investigation of how efficiently the radiation and particle
environment of the young Sun could have influenced the evolution
of the early Venusian atmosphere and its H2O inventory due to
the removal of oxygen picked up by the solar wind. For modelling
the Venusian thermosphere over the planetary history we apply a
diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model
and investigate the heating of the early thermosphere by
photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic
chemical reactions and cooling by CO2 IR emission in the
15$\mu$m band. Our model simulations result in expanded
thermospheres with exobase levels between about 200km at present
and about 2200km 4.5Gyr ago. Moreover, our results yield high
exospheric temperatures during the active phase of the young Sun
even if we assume a ``dry'' CO2 atmosphere with similar
composition that is observed on present Venus of more than 8000K
after the Sun arrived at the zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS).
Exospheric temperatures above about 4000K lead to
diffusion-limited escape and high loss rates for atomic
hydrogen. The duration of this blow-off phase for atomic
hydrogen essentially depends on the mixing ratios of CO2, N2 and
H2O in the early Venusian atmosphere and could last between
about 150 to several hundred Myr, which could result in a large
thermal loss of hydrogen from Venus. For studying how much of
the H2O-related oxygen could have been lost to space by the ion
pick up process due to the stronger solar wind and higher XUV
fluxes of the young Sun we used our modelled atmospheric density
profiles and studied the loss of O+ ion pick up from the upper
atmosphere of Venus over the planet's history by applying a
numerical test particle model. Depending on the used solar wind
parameters, our model simulations show that ion pick up by a
strong early solar wind on a non-magnetized Venus could erode
during 4.6Gyr more than about 250bar of O+ ions, that
corresponds to an equivalent amount of one terrestrial ocean.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the
formation of the Venusian atmosphere and discuss our results in
the frame of previous studies.",

title="The Problem with Pluto: Conflicting Cosmologies and the
Classification of Planets",
author="Messeri, Lisa R",
abstract="In 2006, for the first time in its history, the International
Astronomical Union defined the characteristics of a ?planet? in
our Solar System and consequently demoted Pluto from ?planet? to
?dwarf planet?. Scientific and popular discussion leading up to
and following the formal definition of planet demonstrated that
astronomers, amateurs, educators, and school children had been
employing Pluto in different ways to construct multiple
scientific and cultural cosmologies. Formalizing the definition
brought these cosmologies into direct collision, necessarily
privileging some cosmologies over others. The story of Pluto,
from discovery to demotion, illustrates the discursive
disruption that stemmed from forced consensus. Before ?planet?
received a formal definition, it was a tacitly understood term
that encompassed several meanings and acted as part of the
contact language in a trading zone, as described by Peter
Galison. Social groups were able to clearly communicate using
the word ?planet? despite differing cosmologies. This paper
takes a closer look at Pluto?s history, highlighting three
moments when Pluto?s planetary status was challenged. Each
moment ? a controversial exhibit opening that excluded Pluto
from the planetary display, the discovery of objects in the
Solar System larger than Pluto, and the International
Astronomical Union conference at which astronomers crafted the
definition of planet ? spurred discourse that accentuated
conflicting cosmologies. Actors involved in these incidents
directed the discussion in order to maintain clear communication
or to make sure their cosmologies remained relevant. Only with
the formal definition of planet, which excluded several popular
and scientific cosmologies and shifted discussion about
classification in our Solar System from a prototypical to an
Aristotelian language, was Pluto demoted.",

abstract="The 2015 New Horizons flyby has produced the first
high-resolution maps of morphology and topography of Pluto and
Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated
mosaics of Pluto were produced using both LORRI framing camera
and MVIC line scan camera data, showing the best resolution data
obtained for all areas of the illuminated surface, ∼78\% of the
body. A unique feature of the Pluto imaging data set is the
observation of terrains illuminated only by light scattered from
atmospheric haze, allowing us to map terrains in the southern
hemisphere that would otherwise have been in darkness. MVIC
4-color data were combined with the panchromatic map to produce
full color global maps. Digital elevation models (DEMs) over
∼42\% of Pluto were produced using combinations of MVIC
hemispheric scans and LORRI mosaics, from which slopes at scales
of ∼1 km can be determined. Pluto can be divided into regions
each with distinct topographic signatures, corresponding with
major physiographic terrain types. Large areas of Pluto are
comprised of low-relief moderately cratered plains units. Deeply
pitted and glaciated plains east of Sputnik Planitia are elevated
∼0.7 km. The most dominant topographic feature on Pluto is the
1200-by-2000-km wide depression enclosing the bright Sputnik
Planitia ice sheet, the surface of which is 2.5-to-3.5 km deep
(relative to the rim) and ∼2 km deep relative to the mean radius.
The partial ring of steep-sided massifs, several of which are
more than 5 km high, along the western margins of Sputnik
Planitia produce some of the locally highest and steepest relief
on Pluto, with slopes of 40--50°. The second major topographic
feature is a complex, eroded, ridge-trough system ∼300--400 km
wide and at least 3200 km long extending north-to-south along the
155° meridian. This enormous structure has several kilometers of
relief. It may predate the large impact event forming the basin,
though some post-Sputnik Planitia deformation is evident. The
large depressed, partially walled plain, Hyecho Palus, lies due
southwest of Sputnik Planitia. Near the center of Hyecho Palus
lie the circular constructional edifices Wright and Piccard
Montes. Wright Mons rises 4.5 km above these plains, with a
central depression ∼4.5 km deep, whereas Piccard Mons, best
observed in haze-light, rises ∼5.5 km above the plains but has a
bowl-shaped central depression ∼5.5 km below the plains for a
total relief of up to 11 km, the greatest observed on Pluto. Both
of these features are interpreted as constructional (volcanic?)
in nature. Additional prominent topographic features include a
2--3 km high and ∼600 km wide dome centered on the illuminated
IAU pole and the amoeboidal plateaus of ``bladed'' terrains in
the equatorial region, which rise 2--5 km above local terrains
and are the highest standing geologic units on the encounter
hemisphere. The mean elevations in the integrated DEM for the two
radio occultation areas are consistent with the 5--6 km
difference in elevation as determined independently by the radio
experiment, and a limb profile near the egress point confirms the
presence of elevated bladed terrains in that area. Local relief
of 3--5 km at massifs, troughs and pits supports conclusions that
the icy shell of Pluto is relatively rigid. Numerous examples of
topographic control of ice or frost deposition occur across
Pluto, including the distinct coloration of the polar dome, the
elevated terrains of eastern Tombaugh Regio, and along the
ridge-trough system, where ridge tops and fossae rims are covered
in different ices than at lower elevations. The topographic
hypsogram of Pluto's encounter hemisphere is strongly bimodal due
to the large Sputnik Planitia depression. Otherwise the
topographic signature of Pluto is controlled by deviations from
the otherwise dominant low plains, including elevated bladed
terrain plateaus and the depressed volcanic province including
Wright and Piccard Montes.",

author="Singer, Kelsi N and Alan Stern, S",
abstract="N2 is abundant in Pluto's atmosphere and on its surface, but the
supply is depleted by prodigious atmospheric escape. We
demonstrate that cometary impacts could not have delivered
enough N mass to resupply Pluto's N2 atmospheric escape over
time; thus Pluto's N2 is likely endogenous, and therefore was
either acquired early in its history or created by chemistry
inside Pluto. We find that cratering could excavate a
considerable amount of N2 to resupply the atmosphere against
escape if the near-surface N2 reservoir is deep. However, we
find that this process likely falls short of that necessary to
resupply the atmosphere against escape by at least an order of
magnitude. We conclude that either the escape of N2 from Pluto's
atmosphere was on average much lower than the predictions for
the current epoch, or that internal activity could be necessary
to bring N2 to the surface and resupply escape losses.
Observations made by the New Horizons spacecraft in mid-2015
will yield further constraints on the provenance and evolution
of Pluto's surface and atmospheric N2, and could reveal evidence

abstract="The Virgil Fossae region on Pluto exhibits three spatially
coincident properties that are suggestive of recent cryovolcanic
activity over an area approximately 300 by 200 km. Situated in
the fossae troughs or channels and in the surrounding terrain
are exposures of H2O ice in which there is entrained opaque
red-colored matter of unknown composition. The H2O ice is also
seen to carry spectral signatures at 1.65 and 2.2 $\mu$m of NH3
in some form, possibly as a hydrate, an ammoniated salt, or some
other compound. Model calculations of NH3 destruction in H2O ice
by galactic cosmic rays suggest that the maximum lifetime of NH3
in the uppermost meter of the exposed surface is ~109 years,
while considerations of Lyman-$\alpha$ ultraviolet and solar
wind charged particles suggest shorter timescales by a factor of
10 or 10000. Thus, 109 y is taken as an upper limit to the age
of the emplacement event, and it could be substantially younger.
The red colorant in the ammoniated H2O in Virgil Fossae and
surroundings may be a macromolecular organic material (tholin)
thought to give color to much of Pluto's surface, but probably
different in composition and age. Owing to the limited spectral
range of the New Horizons imaging spectrometer and the signal
precision of the data, apart from the H2O and NH3 signatures
there are no direct spectroscopic clues to the chemistry of the
strongly colored deposit on Pluto. We suggest that the colored
material was a component of the fluid reservoir from which the
material now on the surface in this region was erupted. Although
other compositions are possible, if it is indeed a complex
organic material it may incorporate organics inherited from the
solar nebula, further processed in a warm aqueous environment
inside Pluto. A planet-scale stress pattern in Pluto's
lithosphere induced by true polar wander, freezing of a putative
interior ocean, and surface loading has caused fracturing in a
broad arc west of Sputnik Planitia, consistent with the
structure of Virgil Fossae and similar extensional features.
This faulting may have facilitated the ascent of fluid in
subsurface reservoirs to reach the surface as flows and as
fountains of cryoclastic materials, consistent with the
appearance of colored, ammoniated H2O ice deposits in and around
Virgil Fossae. Models of a cryoflow emerging from sources in
Virgil Fossae indicate that the lateral extent of the flow can
be several km (Umurhan et al., 2019). The deposit over the full
length (>200 km) of the main trough in the Virgil Fossae complex
and extending through the north rim of Elliot crater and varying
in elevation over a range of ~2.5 km, suggests that it debouched
from multiple sources, probably along the length of the strike
direction of the normal faults defining the graben. The source
or sources of the ammoniated H2O are one or more subsurface
reservoirs that may or may not connect to the global ocean
postulated for Pluto's interior. Alternatives to cryovolcanism
in producing the observed characteristics of the region around
Virgil Fossae are explored in the discussion section of the
paper.",

UNIVERSITY APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY/SOUTHWEST RESEARCH
INSTITUTE Last week, 4.7 billion kilometers from Earth and just
a shade past that distant world known as Pluto, a little
plutonium-powered spacecraft torqued itself around and sent home
a 15-minute message. Waiting on the receiving end was Alice
Bowman, the serenely composed operations manager for NASA's
\$720 million New Horizons mission. In other missions, the
engineers who designed the spacecraft or maneuvered it safely
down to the surface of an alien planet have been the
celebrities. On New Horizons, Bowman became a hero by ensuring
that the probe's complex flyby came off without a hitch. Moving
60 times faster than a passenger jet, New Horizons was tearing
through space too quickly for Pluto's weak gravity to reel it
into orbit. The craft had just one chance to observe Pluto and
its moons as it passed within 12,500 kilometers of Pluto's
surface. It had to execute more than 20,000 computer commands
over 9 days and, for 22 climactic hours, could not waste time
and processing power by swiveling around to communicate with
Earth. The 15-minute call home, which began at 8:52:37 p.m. EDT
on 14 July, was the mission controllers' first chance to learn
whether the probe had survived its moment of closest approach. A
collision with just a speck of orbiting dust could have derailed
the entire endeavor. Bowman peered at her computer console in
the mission control room at Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physical Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. Her subordinates
relayed the contents of the message: The spacecraft was on its
target trajectory. Most important, its memory banks were
chock-full of scientific data. ``We have a healthy spacecraft,''
she declared. ``We are outbound from Pluto.'' ![Figure][1]
Norgay Montes (box) flanks Pluto's bright ``heart,''
1600-km-wide Tombaugh Regio. PHOTO: NASA With that, the
spacecraft spun around and went back to work, observing Pluto's
dark side by the reflected light of its moon Charon. The craft's
handlers took a brief break. Clad in black mission polo shirts,
the New Horizons team marched into an APL auditorium for a
victory lap, waving American flags on little sticks. Bowman was
beaming. The audience rose to give her a standing ovation. She
tucked her thumb across her right hand and flashed nine fingers
at the crowd: a ``nine-fingered salute,'' in honor of Pluto's
former status as the solar system's ninth planet. Alan Stern,
the mission's indefatigable principal investigator and a Pluto
champion in the years leading up to the spacecraft's 2006
launch, said he had three words for the world: ``We did it.''
With the flyby complete and the data trickling home, mission
scientists focused on a new challenge: making sense of an
unexpectedly complex and dynamic body. A Pluto image released on
the day of closest approach revealed a world the color of a
peach, mostly smooth but also pocked with cliffs and craters.
Just as images from the Hubble Space Telescope had hinted more
than a decade earlier, Pluto displayed three distinctly colored
regions. At its heart was a heart---a bright beacon of nearly
white ice. Girdling the heart, around Pluto's equator, were
darker terrains, perhaps enriched in organic residue left behind
as the ice sublimed away. At the pole was a medium-bright region
found to be rich in methane ice. To planetary scientists, a
varied surface means a body has hosted some kind of activity.
And activity of any sort is a surprise on Pluto, which receives
a minuscule dose of solar energy and is so small that it should
long ago have lost any internal heat leftover from its formation
or given off by radioactive elements in its interior. To explain
what might be creating the patches, the team bandied two kinds
of explanatory theories: top down and bottom up. Top-down
mechanisms would sculpt the surface from above. Pluto's thin
atmosphere harbors winds blowing at a meter or two per second,
strong enough to erode its surface. What's more, many ices on
Pluto---methane, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide---are volatile.
They can sublime directly into the atmosphere without melting
when the surface warms in the course of Pluto's seasonal cycle,
driven by its sidelong tilt and elongated orbit. When
temperatures drop, they can condense out of the atmosphere as
frost, creating bright patches while concealing other features.
![Figure][1] New Horizons team members view new images at
mission control. ``I think the solar system saved the best for
last.'' Alan Stern , New Horizons principal investigator PHOTO:
NASA/BILL INGALLS For some geoscientists, bottom-up mechanisms
are more provocative: They raise the possibility that Pluto's
interior has somehow remained warm and active billions of years
after its formation. Internal heat could send molten blobs of
material to the surface, driving geysers or even watery
volcanoes that could spew fresh ices onto the surface. That
scenario gained support when an early close-up picture revealed
mountains, some 3500 meters high, composed of water ice. At
Pluto temperatures, water ice is the bedrock: too solid to flow
or sublime. So the presence of ice mountains implies that deep
forces pushed them up. At the same time, surrounding plains of
ice were remarkably crater-free---suggesting that another
process had paved them over. As a first approximation,
researchers estimated that the surfaces were 100 million years
old---a mere blip in geological time---and that resurfacing
could still be happening today. As the team peered closer, other
hints of internal activity emerged. One image showed wind-blown
streaks of material emanating from dark spots just a few
kilometers across---a sign of possible geysers, although the
team was not yet ready to announce a definite discovery. Still,
Mike Brown, a planetary astronomer at the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena, doubts that Pluto is geologically
active today. ``It's a pretty astounding claim, and their
evidence for that is pretty weak,'' he says. The top-down
mechanisms are powerful enough to explain everything scientists
see, Brown says. The ice mountains could easily be ancient, not
young, he says, and the plains could hold craters masked by
thick frosts accumulating from above. Pluto's exceptionally
strong seasons are enhanced by feedback loops in which, for
example, dark patches absorb more heat, accelerating the loss of
ice. Brown expects the heart---named Tombaugh Regio after
Pluto's discoverer---to sublime away in the coming years. As for
the potential geysers, he thinks there may be less to them than
meets the eye. ``They're totally superficial,'' he argues---like
those found on Neptune's moon Triton. Triton is thought to be a
captured object from the Kuiper belt, the throng of icy worlds
to which Pluto also belongs. When the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew
past Triton in 1989, it discovered active geysers, but most
planetary scientists think they are quite shallow---fueled by
sunlight that penetrates clear surface ice and drives a small
greenhouse effect that melts deeper ice. Pluto's moon Charon
could prove key to resolving the riddle. The radioactive fires
stoked by isotopes in its interior should have gone out even
before those on larger Pluto. And Charon lacks an atmosphere and
the volatile ices that can camouflage craters in frost. Yet
early images show that it, like Pluto, is strikingly
unblemished, especially in its southern hemisphere; this
suggests youthfulness, and recent resurfacing. What could be
driving it? One possible solution: The giant impact thought to
have formed Pluto and Charon---and given both bodies an enormous
dose of heat---might not have occurred in the solar system's
early days, 4.5 billion years ago, as most scientists thought.
Instead, the cataclysm could have been more recent, which would
have allowed more heat to persist up until now. Bill Bottke, an
impact expert at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder,
Colorado, is skeptical. Scars in Charon's northern hemisphere
suggest that the moon is old, he notes. What's more, potential
impactors have become increasingly rare over solar system
history, making giant impacts later in time more difficult to
explain, Bottke says. ``I don't like the probabilities,'' he
says. Francis Nimmo, an embedded collaborator on the mission
from the University of California, Santa Cruz, is toying with
another scenario for heating Pluto's interior. ``I'm beginning
to wonder now whether there's some form of tidal heating we've
missed,'' he says. For example, he is considering a second big
impact on Pluto that would have knocked it into a noncircular
orbit around Charon. As gravitational forces slowly rounded out
that ellipse, they could have kneaded both bodies' interiors,
providing an additional heat source. But Nimmo worries that only
an improbably large impact would have supplied enough heat. More
clues may be lurking in the gigabits of data still stored on
board New Horizons. Because of the vast distances and the
spacecraft's low-power radio antenna, it returns data at speeds
of just a few kilobits per second. (A decent Internet connection
today is a thousand times faster.) Only 1\% to 2\% of the
encounter data have been retrieved, and it will take 16 months
to get it all down. For now, Stern is savoring the moment, which
came 50 years to the day after NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft flew
past Mars and returned the first picture from another planet. No
matter that Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet. ``I think
the solar system saved the best for last,'' Stern says. [1]:

abstract="The deep nitrogen-covered basin on Pluto, informally named
Sputnik Planitia, is located very close to the longitude of
Pluto's tidal axis and may be an impact feature, by analogy with
other large basins in the Solar System. Reorientation of Sputnik
Planitia arising from tidal and rotational torques can explain
the basin's present-day location, but requires the feature to be
a positive gravity anomaly, despite its negative topography.
Here we argue that if Sputnik Planitia did indeed form as a
result of an impact and if Pluto possesses a subsurface ocean,
the required positive gravity anomaly would naturally result
because of shell thinning and ocean uplift, followed by later
modest nitrogen deposition. Without a subsurface ocean, a
positive gravity anomaly requires an implausibly thick nitrogen
layer (exceeding 40 kilometres). To prolong the lifetime of such
a subsurface ocean to the present day and to maintain ocean
uplift, a rigid, conductive water-ice shell is required. Because
nitrogen deposition is latitude-dependent, nitrogen loading and
reorientation may have exhibited complex feedbacks.",

atmosphere--topography processes",
author="Bertrand, Tanguy and Forget, Fran{\c c}ois",
abstract="Pluto has a variety of surface frosts and landforms as well as a
complex atmosphere1. There is ongoing geological activity
related to the massive Sputnik Planitia glacier, mostly made of
nitrogen (N2) ice mixed with solid carbon monoxide and methane2,
covering the 4-kilometre-deep, 1,000-kilometre-wide basin of
Sputnik Planitia1,3 near the anti-Charon point. The glacier has
been suggested to arise from a source region connected to the
deep interior, or from a sink collecting the volatiles released
planetwide1. Thin deposits of N2 frost, however, were also
detected at mid-northern latitudes and methane ice was observed
to cover most of Pluto except for the darker, frost-free
equatorial regions2. Here we report numerical simulations of the
evolution of N2, methane and carbon monoxide on Pluto over
thousands of years. The model predicts N2 ice accumulation in
the deepest low-latitude basin and the threefold increase in
atmospheric pressure that has been observed to occur since
19884,5,6. This points to atmospheric--topographic processes as
the origin of Sputnik Planitia's N2 glacier. The same
simulations also reproduce the observed quantities of volatiles
in the atmosphere and show frosts of methane, and sometimes N2,
that seasonally cover the mid- and high latitudes, explaining
the bright northern polar cap reported in the 1990s7,8 and the
observed ice distribution in 20152. The model also predicts that
most of these seasonal frosts should disappear in the next
decade.",

abstract="Abstract The New Horizons spacecraft has found evidence for
geologic activity on the surface of Pluto, including extensional
tectonic deformation of its water ice bedrock see Moore et al.
(2016). One mechanism that could drive extensional tectonic
activity is global surface expansion due to the partial freezing
of an ocean. We use updated physical properties for Pluto and
simulate its thermal evolution to understand the survival of a
possible subsurface ocean. For thermal conductivities of rock
less than 3 W m?1 K?1, an ocean forms and at least partially
freezes, leading to recent extensional stresses in the ice shell.
In scenarios where the ocean freezes and the ice shell is thicker
than 260 km, ice II forms and causes global volume contraction.
Since there is no evidence for recent compressional tectonic
features, we argue that ice II has not formed and that Pluto's
ocean has likely survived to present day.",

Earth-like exoplanets",
author="Frank, Elizabeth A and Meyer, Bradley S and Mojzsis, Stephen J",
abstract="Discoveries of rocky worlds around other stars have inspired
diverse geophysical models of their plausible structures and
tectonic regimes. Severe limitations of observable properties
require many inexact assumptions about key geophysical
characteristics of these planets. We present the output of an
analytical galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model that
quantitatively constrains one of those key properties: radiogenic
heating. Earth's radiogenic heat generation has evolved since its
formation, and the same will apply to exoplanets. We have fit
simulations of the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium
in the solar annulus to the chemistry of our Solar System at the
time of its formation and then applied the carbonaceous
chondrite/Earth's mantle ratio to determine the chemical
composition of what we term ``cosmochemically Earth-like''
exoplanets. Through this approach, predictions of exoplanet
radiogenic heat productions as a function of age have been
derived. The results show that the later a planet forms in
galactic history, the less radiogenic heat it begins with;
however, due to radioactive decay, today, old planets have lower
heat outputs per unit mass than newly formed worlds. The long
half-life of 232Th allows it to continue providing a small amount
of heat in even the most ancient planets, while 40K dominates
heating in young worlds. Through constraining the age-dependent
heat production in exoplanets, we can infer that younger, hotter
rocky planets are more likely to be geologically active and
therefore able to sustain the crustal recycling (e.g. plate
tectonics) that may be a requirement for long-term biosphere
habitability. In the search for Earth-like planets, the focus
should be made on stars within a billion years or so of the Sun's

title="Mobile lid convection beneath Enceladus' south polar terrain",
author="Barr, Amy C",
abstract="Enceladus' south polar region has a large heat flux, 55?110 mW
m?2, that is spatially associated with cryovolcanic and tectonic
activity. Tidal dissipation and vigorous convection in the
underlying ice shell are possible sources of heat, however,
prior predictions of the heat flux carried by stagnant lid
convection range from Fconv ? 15 to 30 mW m?2, too low to
explain the observed heat flux. The high heat flux and increased
cryovolcanic and tectonic activity suggest that near-surface ice
in the region has become rheologically and mechanically weakened
enough to permit convective plumes to reach close to the
surface. If the yield strength of Enceladus' lithosphere is less
than ?1?10 kPa, convection may instead occur in the ?mobile lid?
regime, which is characterized by large heat fluxes and large
horizontal velocities in the near-surface ice. I show that model
ice shells with effective surface viscosities between 1016 and
1017 Pa s and basal viscosities between 1013 and 1015 Pa s have
convective heat fluxes comparable to that observed by Composite
Infrared Spectrometer. If this style of convection is occurring,
the south polar terrain should be spreading horizontally with v
?1?10 mm a?1 (where a is years) and should be resurfaced in
?0.1?10 Ma. On the basis of Cassini imaging data, the south
polar terrain is ?0.5 Ma old, consistent with the mobile lid
hypothesis. Maxwell viscoelastic tidal dissipation in such ice
shells is not capable of generating enough heat to balance
convective heat transport. However, tidal heat may also be
generated in the near-surface along faults as suggested by Nimmo
et al. (2007) and/or viscous dissipation within the ice shell
may occur by other processes not accounted for by the canonical
Maxwell dissipation model.",

(for bodies comparable in size and mass to the Galilean

appropriate material parameters, convective heat-transfer rates
are sufficient to freeze a large liquid mantle on a time scale

long-term stability of surface features to creep deformation.

abstract="Pre-Cassini images of Saturn's small icy moon Enceladus provided
the first indication that this satellite has undergone extensive
resurfacing and tectonism. Data returned by the Cassini
spacecraft have proven Enceladus to be one of the most
geologically dynamic bodies in the Solar System. Given that the
diameter of Enceladus is only about 500 km, this is a surprising
discovery and has made Enceladus an object of much interest.
Determining Enceladus' interior structure is key to
understanding its current activity. Here we use the mean density
of Enceladus (as determined by the Cassini mission to Saturn),
Cassini observations of endogenic activity on Enceladus, and
numerical simulations of Enceladus' thermal evolution to infer
that this satellite is most likely a differentiated body with a
large rock-metal core of radius about 150 to 170 km surrounded
by a liquid water--ice shell. With a silicate mass fraction of
50\% or more, long-term radiogenic heating alone might melt most
of the ice in a homogeneous Enceladus after about 500 Myr
assuming an initial accretion temperature of about 200 K, no
subsolidus convection of the ice, and either a surface
temperature higher than at present or a porous, insulating
surface. Short-lived radioactivity, e.g., the decay of 26Al,
would melt all of the ice and differentiate Enceladus within a
few million years of accretion assuming formation of Enceladus
at a propitious time prior to the decay of 26Al. Long-lived
radioactivity facilitates tidal heating as a source of energy
for differentiation by warming the ice in Enceladus so that
tidal deformation can become effective. This could explain the
difference between Enceladus and Mimas. Mimas, with only a small
rock fraction, has experienced relatively little long-term
radiogenic heating; it has remained cold and stiff and less
susceptible to tidal heating despite its proximity to Saturn and
larger eccentricity than Enceladus. It is shown that the shape
of Enceladus is not that of a body in hydrostatic equilibrium at
its present orbital location and rotation rate. The present
shape could be an equilibrium shape corresponding to a time when
Enceladus was closer to Saturn and spinning more rapidly, or
more likely, to a time when Enceladus was spinning more rapidly
at its present orbital location. A liquid water layer on
Enceladus is a possible source for the plume in the south polar
region assuming the survivability of such a layer to the
present. These results could place Enceladus in a category
similar to the large satellites of Jupiter, with the core having
a rock-metal composition similar to Io, and with a deep
overlying ice shell similar to Europa and Ganymede. Indeed, the
moment of inertia factor of a differentiated Enceladus, C/MR2,
could be as small as that of Ganymede, about 0.31.",

on Enceladus",
author="Roberts, James H and Nimmo, Francis",
abstract="Tidal dissipation has been suggested as the heat source for the
south polar thermal anomaly on Enceladus. We find that under
present-day conditions and assuming Maxwellian behavior, tidal
dissipation is negligible in the silicate core. Dissipation may
be significant in the ice shell if the shell is decoupled from
the silicate core by a subsurface ocean. We have run a series of
self-consistent convection and conduction models in 2D
axisymmetric and 3D spherical geometry in which we include the
spatially-variable tidal heat production. We find that in all
cases, the shell removes more heat from the interior than can be
produced in the core by radioactive decay, resulting in cooling
of the interior and the freezing of any ocean. Under likely
conditions, a 40-km thick ocean made of pure water would freeze
solid on a ∼30 Ma timescale. An ocean containing other chemical
components will have a lower freezing point, but even a
water--ammonia eutectic composition will only prolong the
freezing, not prevent it. If the eccentricity of Enceladus were
higher (e⩾0.015) in the past, the increased dissipation in the
ice shell may have been sufficient to maintain a liquid layer. We
cannot therefore rule out the presence of a transient ocean, as a
relic of an earlier era of greater heating. If the eccentricity
is periodically pumped up, the ocean may have thickened and
thinned on a similar timescale as the orbital evolution, provided
the ocean never froze completely. We conclude that the current
heat flux of Enceladus and any possible subsurface ocean is not
in steady-state, and is the remnant of an epoch of higher
eccentricity and tidal dissipation.",

abstract="Earth, Jupiter's moon Io and Saturn's tiny moon Enceladus are
the only solid objects in the Solar System to be sufficiently
geologically active for their internal heat to be detected by
remote sensing. Interestingly, the endogenic activity on
Enceladus is only located on a specific region at the south
pole, from which jets of water vapor and ice particles have been
observed [Spencer, J.R., and 9 colleagues, 2006. Science 311,
1401--1405; Porco, C.C., and 24 colleagues, 2006. Science 311,
1393--1401]. The current polar location of the thermal anomaly
can possibly be explained by diapir-induced reorientation of the
satellite [Nimmo, F., Pappalardo, R.T., 2006. Nature 441,
614--616], but the thermal anomaly triggering and the heat power
required to sustain it over geological timescales remain
problematic. Using a three-dimensional viscoelastic numerical
model simulating the response of Enceladus to tidal forcing, we
explore the effect of a low-viscosity anomaly in the ice shell,
localized to the south polar region, on the tidal dissipation
patterns. We demonstrate that only interior models with a liquid
water layer at depth can explain the observed magnitude of
dissipation rate and its particular location at the south pole.
Moreover, we show that tidally-induced heat must be generated
over a relatively broad region in the southern hemisphere, and
it is then transferred toward the south pole where it is
episodically released during relatively short resurfacing
events. As large tidal dissipation and internal melting cannot
be induced in the south polar region in the absence of a
pre-existing liquid decoupling layer, we propose that liquid
water must have been present in the interior for a very long
period of time, and possibly since the satellite formation.
Owing to the orbital equilibrium requirement [Meyer, J., Wisdom,
J., 2007. Icarus 188, 535--539], sustaining some liquid water at
depth is impossible if heat is continuously emitted at a rate of
4--8 GW at the south pole. Based on that requirement, we propose
that the current thermal emission is not in equilibrium with the
heat production, and that the thermal emission rate is
abnormally high at present time. Alternatively, continuous
dissipation at a rate of 1--2 GW in the ice shell at the south
pole should be sufficient to induce internal melting and it
could sustain a layer of liquid water at depth over geologic
timescales.",

abstract="Enceladus is one of the most remarkable satellites in the solar
system, as revealed by Cassini's detection of active plumes
erupting from warm fractures near its south pole. This discovery
makes Enceladus the only icy satellite known to exhibit ongoing
internally driven geological activity. The activity is
presumably powered by tidal heating maintained by Enceladus' 2:1
mean-motion resonance with Dione, but many questions remain. For
instance, it appears difficult or impossible to maintain the
currently observed radiated power (probably at least 6 GW) in
steady state. It is also not clear how Enceladus first entered
its current self-maintaining warm and dissipative state- initial
heating from non-tidal sources is probably required. There are
also many unanswered questions about Enceladus' interior. The
silicate fraction inferred from its density of 1:68gcm−2 is
probably differentiated into a core, though we have not direct
evidence for differentiation. Above the core there is probably a
global or regional liquid water layer, inferred from several
models of tidal heating, and an ice shell thick enough to
support the ~1 km amplitude topography seen on Enceladus. It is
possible that dissipation is largely localized beneath the south
polar region. Enceladus' surface geology, ranging from
moderately cratered terrain to the virtually crater-free active
south polar region, is highly diverse, tectonically complex, and
remarkably symmetrical about the rotation axis and the direction
to Saturn. South polar activity is concentrated along the four
``tiger stripe'' fractures, which radiate heat at temperatures
up to at least 167K and are the source of multiple plumes
ejecting ~200kgs−2 of H2O vapor along with significant N2 (or
C2H4), CO2, CH4, NH3, and higher-mass hydrocarbons. The escaping
gas maintains Saturn's neutral gas torus, and the plumes also
eject a large number of micron-sized H2O ice grains that
populate Saturn's E-ring. The mechanism that powers the plumes
is not well understood, and whether liquid water is involved is
a subject of active debate. Enceladus provides perhaps the most
promising potential habitat for life in the outer solar system,
and the active plumes allow the unique opportunity for direct
sampling of that zone. Enceladus is thus a prime target for
Cassini's continued exploration of the Saturn system, and will
be a tempting target for future missions.",

author="Kargel, Jeffrey S and Pozio, Stefania",
abstract="Enceladus has a protracted history of impact cratering,
cryovolcanism, and extensional, compressional, and probable
strike--slip faulting. It is unique in having some of the outer
Solar System's least and most heavily cratered surfaces.
Enceladus' cratering record, tectonic features, and relief
elements have been analyzed more comprehensively than done
previously. Like few other icy satellites, Enceladus seems to
have experienced major lateral lithospheric motions; it may be
the only icy satellite with global features indicating probable
lithospheric convergence and folding. Ridged plains, 500 km
across, consist of a central labyrinthine ridge complex atop a
broad dome surrounded by smooth plains and peripheral sinuous
ridge belts. The ridged plains have few if any signs of
extension, almost no craters, and an average age of just 107to
108years. Ridge belts have local relief ranging from 500 to 2000
m and tend to occur near the bottoms of broad regional troughs
between swells. Our reanalysis of Peter Thomas' (Dermott, S. F.,
and P. C. Thomas, 1994, The determination of the mass and mean
density of Enceladus from its observed shape,Icarus,109,
241--257) limb profiles indicates that high peaks, probably
ridge belts, also occur in unmapped areas. Sinuous ridges appear
foldlike and are similar to terrestrial fold belts such as the
Appalachians. If they are indeed folds, it may require that the
ridged plains are mechanically (perhaps volcanically) layered.
Regional topography suggests that folding may have occurred
along zones of convective downwelling. The cratered plains, in
contrast to the ridged plains, are heavily cratered and exhibit
extensional structures but no obvious signs of compression.
Cratered plains contain a possible strike--slip fault (Isbanir
Fossa), along which two pairs of fractures seem to have 15km of
right-lateral offset. The oldest cratered plains might date from
shortly after the formation of the saturnian system or the
impact disruption and reaccretion of Enceladus. Another area of
cratered plains has modified craters (e.g., Ali Baba and
Aladdin), which some workers have explained by anomalous heat
flow and viscous relaxation; lateral shear and shield-building
volcanism also may have been important. A young rift-like
structure (northern Samarkand Sulci) has few craters and a
concentration of cracks or grabens and flattened, flooded, and
rifted craters. Pit chains and cratered domes suggest explosive
volcanism. Smooth plains may have formed by cryovolcanic
equivalents of flood-basalt volcanism. Pure H2O would be
difficult to extrude through an icy crust and is cosmochemically
improbable as a cryovolcanic agent. Density relations rule out
eutectic brine lavas on Enceladus, but NH3--H2O volcanism is
possible. Current steady-state tidal dissipation may cause
melting of ammonia hydrate at a depth of ∼25 km if the crust is
made of ammonia hydrate or ∼100 km if it is made of water ice.",

systematic variation in scale height with either plume
brightness or Enceladus' orbital position. We compare our
results, both alone and supplemented with Cassini near-infrared
observations, with predictions obtained from models in which
tidal stresses are the principal control of the eruptive
behavior. There are three main ways of explaining the
observations: (1) the activity is controlled by right-lateral
strike slip motion; (2) the activity is driven by eccentricity
tides with an apparent time delay of about 5 hr; (3) the
activity is driven by eccentricity tides plus a 1:1 physical
libration with an amplitude of about 0.°8 (3.5 km). The second
hypothesis might imply either a delayed eruptive response, or a
dissipative, viscoelastic interior. The third hypothesis
requires a libration amplitude an order of magnitude larger than
predicted for a solid Enceladus. While we cannot currently
exclude any of these hypotheses, the third, which is plausible
for an Enceladus with a subsurface ocean, is testable by using
repeat imaging of the moon's surface. A dissipative interior
suggests that a regional background heat source should be
detectable. The lack of a systematic variation in plume scale
height, despite the large variations in plume brightness, is
plausibly the result of supersonic flow; the details of the

take place in Enceladus for a crustal thickness greater than
about 30 km, assuming thermal properties like those of pure H2O
ice. Melting in the interior may have been made more likely by
the presence of NH3, as the H2ONH3 system has a eutectic point
at 173°K. Tidal dissipation seems to be the only heating
mechanism capable of melting Enceladus. For the thermal
properties of pure H2O, the orbital eccentricity would have to
be higher by a factor of 5--7 than the present value of 0.0044
to maintain a molten interior, and may have to be greater by as
much as a factor of 20 to cause melting in an initially frozen
body. If the thermal conductivity is diminished by inclusion of
clathrate hydrates, a significant enhancement over the present
eccentricity would still be required to initiate melting, but it
might be possible to maintain a molten interior and allow
geologic activity with the present eccentricity. Removal of
eccentricity forcing would result in rapid eccentricity damping,
freezing, and cessation of tectonic activity.",

heat pipe mode of heat transport, with magma going up (taking
latent heat) and solid mantle going down. Assuming latent heat
dominates the heat transport, a simplified energy equation is
coupled to the mass conservation equations and a Darcy flow law,
resulting in two coupled, first-order equations for the melt
velocity and melt fraction as functions of depth in the mantle.
Tidal heating is modeled by uniformly distributing the observed

abstract="Abstract Plate tectonics is a unique feature of Earth, and it
plays a dominant role in transporting Earth's internally
generated heat. It also governs the nature, shape, and the motion
of the surface of Earth. The initiation of plate tectonics on
Earth has been difficult to establish observationally, and
modeling of the plate breaking process has not consistently
accounted for the nature of the preplate tectonic Earth. We have
performed numerical simulations of heat transport in the preplate
tectonic Earth to understand the transition to plate tectonic
behavior. This period of time is dominated by volcanic heat
transport called the heat pipe mode of planetary cooling. These
simulations of Earth's mantle include heat transport by melting
and melt segregation (volcanism), Newtonian temperature-dependent
viscosity, and internal heating. We show that when heat pipes are
active, the lithosphere thickens and lithospheric isotherms are
kept flat by the solidus. Both of these effects act to suppress
plate tectonics. As volcanism wanes, conduction begins to control
lithospheric thickness, and large slopes arise at the base of the
lithosphere. This produces large lithospheric stress and focuses
it on the thinner regions of the lithosphere resulting in plate
breaking events.",

used such analogs and models along with Galileo data to
investigate the nature of ultramafic materials that are assumed
to occur at high-temperature hotspots on Io. The unusual
komatiites of the Commondale greenstone belt, South Africa, are
consistent with available Galileo data on the temperatures and
composition of potential Ionian ultramafic materials. These
komatiites had high SiO2 (?50 wt \%) and MgO (?31 wt \%)
contents, which are inferred to result in high liquidus
temperatures (?1610°C), low dynamic viscosities (?0.2 Pa s), and
low densities (?2680 kg/m) and in the crystallization of
orthopyroxene phenocrysts (not found in other komatiites). We
used the Commondale composition and the model of Williams et al.

Compared to their terrestrial counterparts, Ionian ultramafic
lava flows would have less potential for turbulent flow, lower
maximum emplacement distances, and lower thermal erosion rates
because of the lower Ionian gravity and their more silicic
composition. Shallow (10 m) thermal erosion channels seem less
likely on Io, unless (1) lavas are superheated, (2) lavas are
more ultramafic (>31\% MgO), (3) eruption rates, eruption
durations, or flow volumes are high, or (4) substrates are
unconsolidated, partly consolidated, or volatile-rich and thus
more erodable. If volatiles are present in the lava as vesicles,
then increasing lava vesicularity results in decreasing maximum

abstract="The stable, persistent, active lava lake at Erebus volcano (Ross
Island, Antarctica) provides an excellent thermal target for
analysis of spacecraft observations, and for testing new
technology. In the austral summer of 2005 visible and infrared
observations of the Erebus lava lake were obtained with sensors
on three space vehicles Terra (ASTER, MODIS), Aqua (MODIS) and
EO-1 (Hyperion, ALI). Contemporaneous ground-based observations
were obtained with hand-held infrared cameras. This allowed a
quantitative comparison of the thermal data obtained from
different instruments, and of the analytical techniques used to
analyze the data, both with and without the constraints imposed
by ground-truth. From the thermal camera data, in December 2005
the main Erebus lava lake (Ray Lake) had an area of $\approx$820
m2. Surface colour temperatures ranged from 575 K to 1090 K, with
a broad peak in the distribution from 730 K to 850 K. Total heat
loss was estimated at 23.5 MW. The flux density was $\approx$29
kW m−2. Mass flux was estimated at 64 to 93 kg s−1. The best
correlation between thermal emission and emitting area was
obtained with ASTER, which has the best combination of spatial
resolution and wavelength coverage, especially in the thermal
infrared. The high surface temperature of the lava lake means
that Hyperion data are for the most part saturated.
Uncertainties, introduced by the need to remove incident sunlight
cause the thermal emission from the Hyperion data to be a factor
of about two greater than that measured by hand-held thermal
camera. MODIS also over-estimated thermal output from the lava
lake by the same factor of two because it was detecting reflected
sunlight from the rest of the pixel area. The measurement of the
detailed temperature distribution on the surface of an active
terrestrial lava lake will allow testing of thermal emission
models used to interpret remote-sensing data of volcanism on Io,
where no such ground-truth exists. Although the Erebus lava lake
is four orders of magnitude smaller than the lava lake at Pele on
Io, the shape of the integrated thermal emission spectra are
similar. Thermal emission from this style of effusive volcanism
appears to be invariant. Excess thermal emission in most Pele
spectra (compared to Erebus) at short wavelengths (<3 $\mu$m) is
most likely due to disruption of the surface on the lava lake by
escaping volatiles.",

abstract="Active volcanism observed on Io is thought to be driven by the
temporally periodic, spatially differential projection of
Jupiter's gravitational field over the moon. Previous
theoretical estimates of the tidal heat have all treated Io as
essentially a solid, with fluids addressed only through
adjustment of rheological parameters rather than through
appropriate extension of the dynamics. These previous estimates
of the tidal response and associated heat generation on Io are
therefore incomplete and possibly erroneous because dynamical
aspects of the fluid behavior are not permitted in the modeling
approach. Here we address this by modeling the partial-melt
asthenosphere as a global layer of fluid governed by the Laplace
Tidal Equations. Solutions for the tidal response are then
compared with solutions obtained following the traditional
solid-material approach. It is found that the tidal heat in the
solid can match that of the average observed heat flux
(nominally 2.25 W m−2), though only over a very restricted range
of plausible parameters, and that the distribution of the solid
tidal heat flux cannot readily explain a longitudinal shift in
the observed (inferred) low-latitude heat fluxes. The tidal heat
in the fluid reaches that observed over a wider range of
plausible parameters, and can also readily provide the
longitudinal offset. Finally, expected feedbacks and coupling
between the solid/fluid tides are discussed. Most broadly, the
results suggest that both solid and fluid tidal-response
estimates must be considered in exoplanet studies, particularly
where orbital migration under tidal dissipation is addressed.",

abstract="Active volcanism on Io has been monitored during the nominal
Galileo satellite tour from mid 1996 through late 1997. The Solid
State Imaging (SSI) experiment was able to observe many
manifestations of this active volcanism, including (1) changes in
the color and albedo of the surface, (2) active airborne plumes,
and (3) glowing vents seen in eclipse. About 30 large-scale (tens
of kilometers) surface changes are obvious from comparison of the
SSI images to those acquired by Voyager in 1979. These include
new pyroclastic deposits of several colors, bright and dark
flows, and caldera-floor materials. There have also been
significant surface changes on Io during the Galileo mission
itself, such as a new 400-km-diameter dark pyroclastic deposit
around Pillan Patera. While these surface changes are impressive,
the number of large-scale changes observed in the four months
between the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 flybys in 1979 suggested that
over 17 years the cumulative changes would have been much more
impressive. There are two reasons why this was not actually the
case. First, it appears that the most widespread plume deposits
are ephemeral and seem to disappear within a few years. Second,
it appears that a large fraction of the volcanic activity is
confined to repeated resurfacing of dark calderas and flow fields
that cover only a few percent of Io's surface. The plume
monitoring has revealed 10 active plumes, comparable to the 9
plumes observed by Voyager. One of these plumes was visible only
in the first orbit and three became active in the later orbits.
Only the Prometheus plume has been consistently active and easy
to detect. Observations of the Pele plume have been particularly
intriguing since it was detected only once by SSI, despite
repeated attempts, but has been detected several times by the
Hubble Space Telescope at 255 nm. Pele's plume is much taller
(460 km) than during Voyager 1 (300 km) and much fainter at
visible wavelengths. Prometheus-type plumes (50--150 km high,
long-lived, associated with high-temperature hot spots) may
result from silicate lava flows or shallow intrusions interacting
with near-surface SO2. A major and surprising result is that ∼30
of Io's volcanic vents glow in the dark at the short wavelengths
of SSI. These are probably due to thermal emission from surfaces
hotter than 700 K (with most hotter than 1000 K), well above the
temperature of pure sulfur volcanism. Active silicate volcanism
appears ubiquitous. There are also widespread diffuse glows seen
in eclipse, related to the interaction of energetic particles
with the atmosphere. These diffuse glows are closely associated
with the most active volcanic vents, supporting suggestions that
Io's atmopshere is dominated by volcanic outgassing. Globally,
volcanic centers are rather evenly distributed. However, 14 of
the 15 active plumes seen by Voyager and/or Galileo are within
30° of the equator, and there are concentrations of glows seen in
eclipse at both the sub- and antijovian points. These patterns
might be related to asthenospheric tidal heating or tidal
stresses. Io will continue to be observed during the Galileo
Europa Mission, which will climax with two close flybys of Io in
late 1999.",

compositions and masses of central planets. The Moon is the only
extraterrestrial body for which we have information about the
mantle seismic velocities as a function of depth. Volcanic
activity on the Moon was completed in the early stage of its
evolution. Io is the most active of all known satellites and it
is much richer in volatiles and iron than the Moon. In this work,
internally consistent models of the constitution of the Moon and
Io based on the geophysical (the seismic velocities, the mass and
moment of inertia) and geochemical (chemical and phase
composition) constraints are compared. Thermodynamic modeling of
the phase relations and physical properties in the
CaO--FeO--MgO--Al2O3--SiO2--Fe--FeS system was used to estimate
the bulk composition, the density distribution in the mantle and
radius of a core from the geophysical data. The solution of the
inverse problem is based on the minimization of the deviations
between the calculated and observed geophysical parameters. The
smallest and largest core radii are estimated to be: 500--655 km
for an Fe core (6--10\%) and 810--1080 km for an FeS core
(12--28\% of total mass) for Io; 290--345 km for an Fe core
(1.1--1.9\%) and 450--530 km for an FeS core (2.4--4\% of total
mass) for the Moon. The atomic ratios of total iron to silicon
for Io are estimated to be (Fe/Si)=0.40--0.66 in comparison with
0.22--0.24 for the Moon, 0.51--0.59 for the LL and L chondrites,
and 0.74--0.8 for CV3 and CM2 meteorites. The current results
show that the proposed Io's compositions similar to that of
carbonaceous chondrites do not satisfy to bulk Fe/Si ratios
inferred from the geophysical constraints. The bulk composition
of Io is estimated to be close to that of the L and LL chondrites
having 8--13 wt.\% of iron and iron sulfide; a change of the core
composition from pure iron to pure iron sulfide leads to a change
of the core radius from 600 to 625 km (8--9\%) to 930--965 km
(18--20\%); the radius of the eutectic Fe--FeS-core is estimated
to be 840--870 km (14--16\% of Io's mass; (Fe/Si)at=0.55--0.57).
If Io does have such a composition, then the core is probably Fe
or Fe-rich, whereas a large FeS core is excluded by the
composition of the L and LL chondrites. A comparison of estimated
bulk chemistry of Io with much more reliable composition of the
Moon shows that Earth's and Jupiter's satellites have absolutely
different bulk compositions.",

mechanism. Despite ubiquitous extension and creation of new
surface area at dilational bands that resemble terrestrial
mid-ocean spreading zones, there is little evidence of
large-scale contraction to balance the observed extension or to
recycle ageing terrains. We address this enigma by presenting
several lines of evidence that subduction may be recycling
surface material into the interior of Europa's ice shell. Using
Galileo spacecraft images, we produce a tectonic reconstruction
of geologic features across a 134,000 km2 region of Europa and
find, in addition to dilational band spreading, evidence for
transform motions along prominent strike-slip faults, as well as
the removal of approximately 20,000 km2 of the surface along a
discrete tabular zone. We interpret this zone as a
subduction-like convergent boundary that abruptly truncates
older geological features and is flanked by potential cryolavas
on the overriding ice. We propose that Europa's ice shell has a
brittle, mobile, plate-like system above convecting warmer ice.

Super-Earths---planets lighter than ten Earth masses---around

nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler, the method of transit
timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique for
characterizing the gravitational effects of mutual planetary
perturbations for hundreds of planets. TTVs can provide precise,
but complex, constraints on planetary masses, densities, and
orbits, even for planetary systems with faint host stars. In the
coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations into
increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital
evolution of planetary systems with low-mass planets. Between
TTVs, improved Doppler surveys, high-contrast imaging campaigns,
and microlensing surveys, astronomers can look forward to a much
better understanding of planet formation in the coming decade.",

abstract="Numerical simulations of mantle convection with a
damage-grainsize feedback are used to develop scaling laws for
predicting conditions at which super-Earths would have plate
tectonics. In particular, the numerical simulations are used to
determine how large a viscosity ratio between pristine
lithosphere and mantle ($\mu$l/$\mu$m) can be offset by damage to
allow mobile (plate-like) convection. Regime diagrams of
$\mu$l/$\mu$m versus the damage number (D) show that the
transition from stagnant lid to mobile convection occurs for
higher $\mu$l/$\mu$m as D increases; a similar trend occurs for
increasing Rayleigh number. We hypothesize a new criterion for
the onset of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets: that damage
must reduce the viscosity of shear zones in the lithosphere to a
critical value equivalent to the underlying mantle viscosity; a
scaling law based on this hypothesis reproduces the numerical
results. For the Earth, damage is efficient in the lithosphere
and provides a viable mechanism for the operation of plate
tectonics. We scale our theory to super-Earths and map out the
transition between plate-like and stagnant-lid convection with a
``planetary plate-tectonic phase'' diagram in planet size-surface
temperature space. Both size and surface conditions are found to
be important, with plate tectonics being favored for larger,
cooler planets. This gives a natural explanation for Earth,
Venus, and Mars, and implies that plate tectonics on exoplanets
should correlate with size, incident solar radiation, and
atmospheric composition.",

their surface conditions and thermal structure. Both are
dependent on the tectonic regime of a planet, which is itself a
function of the balance between driving forces, and the resistive
strength of the lithosphere. Here we use mantle convection
simulations to show that simply increasing planetary radius acts
to decrease the ratio of driving to resisting stresses, and thus
super-sized Earths are likely to be in an episodic or stagnant
lid regime. This effect is robust when associated increases in
gravity are included, as the more dominant effect is increased
fault strength rather than greater buoyancy forces. The

abstract="Models of the dynamical evolution of the early solar system that
follow the dispersal of the gaseous protoplanetary disk have
been widely successful in reconstructing the current orbital
configuration of the giant planets. Statistically, some of the
most successful dynamical evolution simulations have initially
included a hypothetical fifth giant planet, of ice giant (IG)
mass, which gets ejected by a gas giant during the early solar
system's proposed instability phase. We investigate the
likelihood of an IG ejection (IGE) event by either Jupiter or
Saturn through constraints imposed by the current orbits of
their wide-separation regular satellites Callisto and Iapetus,
respectively. We show that planetary encounters that are
sufficient to eject an IG often provide excessive perturbations
to the orbits of Callisto and Iapetus, making it difficult to
reconcile a planet ejection event with the current orbit of
either satellite. Quantitatively, we compute the likelihood of
reconciling a regular Jovian satellite orbit with the current
orbit of Callisto following an IGE by Jupiter of ∼42\%, and
conclude that such a large likelihood supports the hypothesis of
a fifth giant planet's existence. A similar calculation for
Iapetus reveals that it is much more difficult for Saturn to
have ejected an IG and reconciled a Kronian satellite orbit with
that of Iapetus (likelihood ∼1\%), although uncertainties
regarding the formation of Iapetus, with its unusual orbit,
complicates the interpretation of this result.",

abstract="GJ 1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets,
because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission
spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the
composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high
molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if
hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water
dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the
envelope obtained by using an internal structure and
evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining
all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding
opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ 1214b is
at most 7\% by mass. In general, we find the radius of warm
sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note
that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e,
Kepler-36c, and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b)
of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10\%
H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10\%-18\% and
5\%-15\% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about
the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that
although a 100\% water composition fits the data for GJ 1214b,
based on formation constraints the presence of heavier
refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is
a component lighter than water required. The same is true for
Kepler-11f. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy
of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ 1214b will help
determine the extent of compositional segregation between the

abstract="New transiting planet candidates are identified in 16 months
(2009 May-2010 September) of data from the Kepler spacecraft.
Nearly 5000 periodic transit-like signals are vetted against
astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1108
viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to
over 2300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing
to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the
noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center
offsets derived from difference image analysis that identifies
likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of
photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of
the candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T 0, and orbital
period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve
modeling: reduced radius (R P/R ⋆), reduced semimajor axis (d/R
⋆), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases
are seen for the smallest planet candidates (201\% for
candidates smaller than 2 R ⊕ compared to 53\% for candidates
larger than 2 R ⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (124\%
for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 86\% for
candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than
expected from increasing the observing window from 13 months
(Quarters 1-5) to 16 months (Quarters 1-6) even in regions of
parameter space where one would have expected the previous
catalogs to be complete. Analyses of planet frequencies based on
previous catalogs will be affected by such incompleteness. The
fraction of all planet candidate host stars with multiple
candidates has grown from 17\% to 20\%, and the paucity of
short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident.

abstract="Coronae on Venus range from 60 to over 2000 km across and are
characterized by a complex range of morphologies. The annuli
around coronae range from about 10 to 150 km across and have
tectonic features ranging from extensional to compressional to a
combination of both. Topographically, coronae are domes,
plateaus, plateaus with interior lows, and rimmed depressions. A
subset of features classified here as coronae corresponds to
depressions and is interpreted to consist of large-scale
calderas. A number of features have been identified with many of
the basic characteristics of coronae (similar interior
deformation, associations with volcanism, high topography) but
lacking a distinct tectonic annulus. These features tend to be
somewhat smaller than coronae and may represent ?failed? coronae
or coronae in an early stage of evolution. The size distribution
of coronae and coronalike features with maximum widths greater
than about 250 km is well represented by a power law of the form
N(D) = kD?$\alpha$, where N is the number of coronae with
maximum widths greater than D (km) and $\alpha$ = 3.05. The
spatial distribution of coronae is not random; the features are
concentrated in a few groups and along several chains. Coronae
are similar in many morphologic characteristics to major
volcanic shield structures and volcanic rises such as Western
Eistla Regio. The largest corona, Artemis, is actually larger
than several volcanic rises on Venus. Coronae and volcanic rises
appear to be surface manifestations of mantle plumes. There is
no evidence of any systematic variation in age along chains of
coronae as occurs in hotspot chains on Earth. Instead, a number
of multiple and overlapping coronae may indicate limited
movement of the surface above a hotspot or mantle plume. The
morphology and size distribution of coronae, highlands, and
major shields suggest that mantle upwelling on Venus operates
either on several spatial scales, with coronae representing
smaller-scale upflows and major volcanic rises representing
larger convective upwellings, or on several temporal scales,
with coronae representing shorter duration upflows and major
volcanic rises representing long-term upwellings.",

title="Plate tectonics and the undation model: A comparison",
author="Van Bemmelen, R W",
abstract="The modern geodynamic model known as `New Global Tectonics' or
`Plate Tectonics', elaborated in the past twenty years, is the
synthetic result of the great post-war advances achieved in
marine geophysical methods, deep-sea drilling technology,
worldwide monitoring of earthquakes and paleomagnetics. It
represents a `mobilistic' view of the earth based on continental
drift and sea-floor spreading (as outward manifestation) and
convection currents in the mantle (as interior driving motor).
The predictions of this model appear to correspond fairly well
with observations about the kinematic evolution of the
lithosphere during its younger (or Phanerozoic) phase.
Extrapolations to Precambrian times run into conflict, however,
with our knowledge of the earlier global evolution and some major
revisions of the model appear to be imperative, especially in the
field of geochemistry. In comparison, the model of the `undation
theory', conceived since 1931, has grown into a synthesis between
the (sometimes extreme) mobilistic and fixistic positions. Its
driving force is supposed to be primarily provided by the
liberation of free energy in the earth's core and its stepwise
rise to the surface in an irreversibly outward transport. This
general form of energy flow occurs through rheological and
geochemical processes, which lead to accumulation of potential
energy and its release expressed primarily by vertical
deformations of the surface --- called `undations' ---, of
various dimensions. By means of the prognosis---diagnosis method
of scientific verification, this view has been repeatedly checked
in test-cases of global tectonics. A notable item of this paper
is the checking of both models by a comparison of global tectonic
features and the major anomalies of the earth's gravity field (as
ascertained from the deviations observed in the orbits of
man-made satellites). A plausible rheological interpretation of
these geoidal anomalies through their correlation with the major
tectonic features of the earth can be produced by the undation
model, whereas (so far) the model of the new global tectonics has
remained silent on this allimportant geodynamic issue.",

scenarios for the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is
hampered by the fact that subduction initiation processes must
have been markedly different before the onset of global plate
tectonics because most present-day subduction initiation
mechanisms require acting plate forces and existing zones of
lithospheric weakness, which are both consequences of plate
tectonics. However, plume-induced subduction initiation could
have started the first subduction zone without the help of plate
tectonics. Here, we test this mechanism using high-resolution
three-dimensional numerical thermomechanical modelling. We
demonstrate that three key physical factors combine to trigger
self-sustained subduction: (1) a strong, negatively buoyant
oceanic lithosphere; (2) focused magmatic weakening and thinning
of lithosphere above the plume; and (3) lubrication of the slab
interface by hydrated crust. We also show that plume-induced
subduction could only have been feasible in the hotter early
Earth for old oceanic plates. In contrast, younger plates
favoured episodic lithospheric drips rather than self-sustained
subduction and global plate tectonics.",

tectonic regime began, about $$2 \textbackslashtimes 10^\{9\}$$
years B.P., divergent plate motion has commonly begun at axial
dikes emplaced in rifts formed in this way. A normal course of
events is that two of the rifts meeting at a junction to open by
plate accretion while the third rift becomes inactive as a
failed arm. The evolution of 45 selected junctions, with ages

develop. Bends in rifted Atlantic-type continental margins
reflect the distribution of triple junctions at the time
continents parted and plume traces on ocean floors lead away
from these former triple junctions. Where oceans have closed by
continental collision, rifts (failed arms) (aulacogens of Soviet

location of former triple junctions. Reactivation of old rifts

author="M{\`e}ge, Daniel and Masson, Philippe",
abstract="Morphological and structural data from the whole Tharsis province
suggest that a number of shallow grabens radially oriented about
the Tharsis bulge on Mars are underlain by dykes, which define
giant radiating swarms similar to, e.g. the Mackenzie dyke swarm
of the Canadian shield. Mechanisms for graben formation are
proposed, and the depth, width, and height of the associated
dykes are estimated. Structural mapping leads to define
successive stages of dyke emplacement, and provide
stress-trajectory maps that indicate a steady source of the
regional stress during the whole history of the Tharsis province.
A new tectonic model of Tharsis is presented, based on an analogy
with dyke swarms on the Earth that form inside hot spots. This
model successfully matches the following features: (1) the
geometry of the South Tharsis Ridge Belt, which may have been a
consequence of the compressional stress field at the boundary
between the uplifted and non-uplifted areas in the upper part of
the lithosphere at the onset of hot spot activity; (2) extensive
lava flooding, interpreted as a consequence of the high thermal
anomaly at the onset of plume (hot spot) activity; (3) wrinkle
ridge geometry in the Tharsis hemisphere, the formation of which
is interpreted as a consequence of buoyant subsidence of the
brittle crust in response to the lava load; (4) Valles Marineris
limited stretching by preliminary passive rifting, and uplift,
viewed as a necessary consequence of adiabatic mantle
decompression induced by stretching. The geometrical analysis of
dyke swarms suggests the existence of a large,
Tharsis-independent extensional state of stress during all the
period of tectonic activity, in which the minimum compressive
stress is roughly NS oriented. Although magmatism must have
loaded the lithosphere significantly after the plume activity
ceased and be responsible for additional surface deformations,
there is no requirement for further loading stress to explain
surficial features. Comparison with succession of magmatic and
tectonic events related to hot spots on the Earth suggests that
the total time required to produce all the surface deformation
observed in the Tharsis province over the last 3.8 Ga does
probably not exceed 10 or 15 Ma.",

implications for present-day mantle convection on Mars",
author="Kiefer, Walter S",
abstract="Abstract? Radiometric age dating of the shergottite meteorites
and cratering studies of lava flows in Tharsis and Elysium both
demonstrate that volcanic activity has occurred on Mars in the
geologically recent past. This implies that adiabatic
decompression melting and upwelling convective flow in the mantle
remains important on Mars at present. I present a series of
numerical simulations of mantle convection and magma generation
on Mars. These models test the effects of the total radioactive
heating budget and of the partitioning of radioactivity between
crust and mantle on the production of magma. In these models,
melting is restricted to the heads of hot mantle plumes that rise
from the core-mantle boundary, consistent with the spatially
localized distribution of recent volcanism on Mars. For magma
production to occur on present-day Mars, the minimum average
radioactive heating rate in the martian mantle is 1.6 times 10?12
W/kg, which corresponds to 39\% of the Wanke and Dreibus (1994)
radioactivity abundance. If the mantle heating rate is lower than
this, the mean mantle temperature is low, and the mantle plumes
experience large amounts of cooling as they rise from the base of
the mantle to the surface and are, thus, unable to melt. Models
with mantle radioactive heating rates of 1.8 to 2.1 times 10 ?12
W/kg can satisfy both the present-day volcanic resurfacing rate
on Mars and the typical melt fraction observed in the
shergottites. This corresponds to 43?50\% of the Wanke and
Dreibus radioactivity remaining in the mantle, which is
geochemically reasonable for a 50 km thick crust formed by about
10\% partial melting. Plausible changes to either the assumed
solidus temperature or to the assumed core-mantle boundary
temperature would require a larger amount of mantle radioactivity
to permit present-day magmatism. These heating rates are slightly
higher than inferred for the nakhlite source region and
significantly higher than inferred from depleted shergottites
such as QUE 94201. The geophysical estimate of mantle
radioactivity inferred here is a global average value, while
values inferred from the martian meteorites are for particular
points in the martian mantle. Evidently, the martian mantle has
several isotopically distinct compositions, possibly including a
radioactively enriched source that has not yet been sampled by
the martian meteorites. The minimum mantle heating rate
corresponds to a minimum thermal Rayleigh number of 2 times 106,
implying that mantle convection remains moderately vigorous on
present-day Mars. The basic convective pattern on Mars appears to
have been stable for most of martian history, which has prevented
the mantle flow from destroying the isotopic heterogeneity.",

abstract="There is a long-standing hypothesis that the last fraction of
the lunar magma ocean crystallized into a layer of dense,
Ti-rich cumulate minerals at shallow depths (∼100 km) early in
the moon's history. Many questions remain about the stability of
these high-Ti cumulates. It has been suggested that the
cumulates subsequently sank deep into the moon because of
gravitational instability, but high-Ti material is required at
shallower depths by 3.5 Ga to create the high-Ti mare basalts
and picritic glasses. The high-Ti material may have re-erupted
from depth, or some or all of it may have remained at shallow
depths throughout lunar history. Data on phase stabilities, bulk
compositions, densities, and temperatures of melting and
crystallizing in addition to results from numerical modeling
suggest that the high-Ti cumulates would sink only under highly
specific conditions. Five scenarios for sinking high-Ti cumulate
materials are examined, and only two are found plausible. In
particular, it is found that simple sinking of solidified
high-Ti cumulates is unlikely because the temperature at which
the cumulates solidify is low, and viscosity under these
conditions is very high. It is, however, possible that high-Ti
cumulates mixed with a substantial fraction of olivine would
have viscosity low enough to allow them to sink as solids.
Further, because clinopyroxene and ilmenite melt in a ratio of
2:1, remelted high-Ti cumulates would be negatively buoyant and
sink as liquids, percolating downward through the underlying
mantle and beginning to recrystallize ilmenite at 200 km depth,
making a hybrid, heterogeneous mantle.",

abstract="Crystallization of the Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) has been
numerically modeled and its products inferred from sample
observations, but it has never been fully tested experimentally.
This study is a reexamination of the LMO hypothesis by means of
the first experimental simulation of lunar differentiation. Two
end-member bulk Moon compositions are considered: one enriched
in refractory lithophile elements relative to Earth and one with
no such enrichment. A ``two-stage'' model of magma ocean
crystallization based on geophysical constraints is simulated
and features early crystal suspension and equilibrium
crystallization followed by fractional crystallization of the
residual magma ocean. An initially entirely molten Moon is
assumed. Part 1 of this study, presented here, focuses on stage
1 of this model and considers the early cumulates formed by
equilibrium crystallization, differences in mantle mineralogy
resulting from different bulk Moon compositions, and
implications for the source regions of the highlands Mg-suite.
Refractory element enriched bulk Moon compositions produce a
deep mantle that contains garnet and trace Cr-spinel in addition
to low-Ca pyroxene and olivine. In contrast, compositions
without refractory element enrichment produce a deep dunitic
mantle with low-Ca pyroxene but without an aluminous phase. The
differences in bulk composition are magnified in the residual
melt; the residual LMO from the refractory element enriched
composition will likely produce plagioclase and ilmenite earlier
and in greater quantities. Both compositions produce Mg-rich
early cumulate piles that extend from the core-mantle boundary
to ∼355km depth, if 50\% equilibrium crystallization and whole
Moon melting are assumed. These early LMO cumulates provide good
fits for the source regions for a component of the high-Mg∗, Ni-
and Co-poor parental magmas of the Mg-suite cumulates, if
certain conditions are called upon. The olivine in early LMO
cumulates produced by either bulk Moon composition is far too
rich in Cr to be reasonable for the source regions of the
Mg-suite, meaning either core formation in the presence of S
and/or C must be invoked to deplete the LMO and the
crystallizing olivine in Cr, or that current estimates of the
bulk lunar Cr content are too high. We infer that melts meeting
the criteria of the Mg-suite parents could be produced from
early LMO cumulates by solid state KREEP and plagioclase
hybridization near the base of the crust and subsequent partial
melting. Additionally, we propose a revised model for Mg-suite

author="Elkins-Tanton, Linda T and Burgess, Seth and Yin, Qing-Zhu",
abstract="The Moon is thought to have originated with a magma ocean that
produced a plagioclase flotation crust as solidification
proceeded. Ages of anorthositic crust range over at least
200million years. The model for solidification presented here
integrates chemical and physical constraints of lunar magma ocean
solidification to determine (1) the final thickness of flotation
crust generated by a fractionally solidifying magma ocean, (2)
the timescale of crystallization before plagioclase is a stable
phase, (3) the timescale of solidification after the formation of
the plagioclase flotation crust, and (4) the post-overturn lunar
mantle composition and structure. We find that magma oceans of as
much as 1000km depth are consistent with creating an anorthositic
crust 40 to 50km in thickness. Solidification of the magma ocean
prior to formation of the flotation crust may occur on the order
of 1000years, and complete solidification would require
additional ten to tens of millions of years. Reconciling these
short model timescales with radiometric dates of crustal samples
requires either a very late-forming Moon combined with finding
older crustal ages to be incorrect, or calling on tidal heating
of the crust by the early Earth to prolong solidification.
Gravitationally driven overturn of cumulates during tidal heating
provides a mechanism for creating the compositions and ages of
the lunar Mg suite of crustal rocks. Further, we find that upon
crystallization, the Moon likely began with an azimuthally
heterogeneous, gravitationally stable mantle, after magma ocean
cumulate overturn. This result may help explain the
experimentally determined origin of picritic glasses at similar

Studies with a nonlinear seasonal energy balance model",

abstract="The seasonal cycle of surface temperature is largely controlled
by the land-sea distribution. Previous studies with a
two-dimensional, seasonal energy balance model (EBM) suggested
that large annual cycles on supercontinents could produce
sufficiently high summer temperatures to melt summer snow, even
when the continents were located in polar regions. The above
calculations were done with a linear model. In this paper we
test the sensitivity of these conclusions to seasonally varying
snow albedo feedback by developing a new nonlinear
two-dimensional, seasonal EBM. The model satisfactorily
reproduces the present annual and semiannual cycles, plus snow
and sea ice margins; its sensitivity is $\approx$ 25\% greater
than that of the linear model and comparable to a number of
general circulation model (GCM) studies for altered CO2 levels.
Experiments are described for a series of idealized
supercontinent configurations; in addition we examine the effect
of changing land-sea distributions on the climate of Greenland
and Antarctica. Supercontinent model simulations are similar to
the previously published linear model results and provide
further support for the hypothesis that ice-free states could
occur on polar supercontinents. However, some of our results for
smaller land masses differ from the earlier study. Although
temperatures are systematically lower for the nonlinear run, we
simulate >15°C decrease in summer temperatures over Greenland
during the last 100 million years in both the linear and
nonlinear models. However, there is only a weak suggestion of a
long-term trend in the southern hemisphere. Revised
reconstructions of southern hemisphere geography further obscure
any long-term trend in this region. Overall, model simulations
provide further support for the proposition that changes in
seasonality have played an important role in climate change over
the past few hundred million years.",

between the potential energy change of the subducting slab and
viscous dissipation in the mantle, bending lithosphere, and
slab--upper plate interface. A range of observations suggest
that slabs may be weak, implying a more prominent role for plate
interface dissipation than previously thought. The shallow
thrust interface is commonly assumed to be weak due to an
abundance of fluids and near-lithostatic pore fluid pressures,
but little attention has been paid to the influence of the
deeper, viscous interface. Here we show that the deep interface
viscosity in subduction zones is strongly affected by the
relative proportions of sedimentary to mafic rocks that are
subducted to depth. Where sediments on the down-going plate are
sparse, the deep interface is dominated by mafic lithologies
that metamorphose to eclogites, which exhibit viscosities 1--2
orders of magnitude higher than the asthenospheric mantle, and
reduce subduction plate speeds. In contrast, where sediments are
abundant and subducted to depth, the deep interface viscosity is
1--2 orders of magnitude lower than the asthenospheric mantle,
thus allowing significantly faster plate velocities. This
correlation between subduction plate speed and deep sediment
subduction may help explain dramatic accelerations (or
decelerations) in convergence rates, such as the acceleration

abstract="We study the interactions between the geochemical cycles of
carbon and long-term changes in climate. Climate change is
studied with a simple, zonally averaged energy balance climate
model that includes the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide
explicitly. The geochemical model balances the rate of
consumption of carbon dioxide in silicate weathering against its
release by volcanic and metamorphic processes. The silicate
weathering rate is expressed locally as a function of
temperature, carbon dioxide partial pressure, and runoff. The
global weathering rate is calculated by integrating these
quantities over the land area as a function of latitude. Carbon
dioxide feedback stabilizes the climate system against a
reduction in solar luminosity and may contribute to the
preservation of equable climate on the early Earth, when solar
luminosity was low. The system responds to reduced land area by
increasing carbon dioxide partial pressure and warming the globe.
Our model makes it possible to study the response of the system
to changing latitudinal distribution of the continents. A
concentration of land area at high latitudes leads to high carbon
dioxide partial pressures and high global average temperature
because weathering of high-latitude continents is slow.
Conversely, concentration of the continents at low latitudes
yields a cold globe and ice at low latitudes, a situation that
appears to be representative of the late Precambrian glacial
episode. This model is stable against ice albedo catastrophe even
when the ice line occurs at low latitudes. In this it differs

upwelling plumes, lower mantle chemical heterogeneities, and thus
plausibly contributing to voluminous volcanism that is often

volcanism include insulation by the continent and thus elevated
subcontinental mantle temperatures. Here we model the thermal and
dynamic impact of supercontinents on Earth-like mobile-lid
convecting systems. We confirm that insulating supercontinents
(over 3000 km extent) can impact mantle temperatures, but show
the scale of temperature anomaly is significantly less for
systems with strongly temperature-dependent viscosities and
mobile continents. Additionally, for continents over 8000 km,
mantle temperatures are modulated by the development of
small-scale convecting systems under the continent, which arise
due to inefficient lateral convection of heat at these scales. We
demonstrate a statistically robust association between rising
plumes supercontinental interiors for a variety of continental
configurations, driven largely by the tendency of subducting
slabs to lock onto continental margins. The distribution of slabs
also affects the spatial positioning of deep mantle
thermochemical anomalies, which demonstrate stable configurations
in either the sub-supercontinent or intraoceanic domains. We find

are differing views on what role continental insulation plays in
the production of elevated mantle temperatures. Here we
investigate how the heating mode of the mantle can change the
influence of the ?thermal blanket? effect. We present 2?D and 3?D

evolution of mantle thermal structure is examined after
continental accretion at subduction zones (e.g., the formation of

results show that in low?Rayleigh number models the impact of the
role of continental insulation on subcontinental temperatures
increases, when compared to models with higher convective vigor.
Broad, hot upper mantle features generated in low?Rayleigh number
models (due, in part, to the thermal blanket effect) are absent
at higher Rayleigh numbers. We find that subcontinental heating
in a high?Rayleigh number flow occurs almost entirely as a
consequence of the influence of subduction initiation at the

Pacific formed in the Pacific geoid high and this may have been
the early Mesozoic--late Palaeozoic position of a large part of
Asia and other fragments of the Pacific rim continents. The major
global geoid highs were regions of extensive Cretaceous volcanism

operated throughout Earth's history, but are difficult to

poorly known. Here we show that the time dependence of
global-scale mantle flow can be deduced from the net behaviour of
surface plate motions. In particular, we tracked the geographic
locations of net convergence and divergence for harmonic degrees
1 and 2 by computing the dipole and quadrupole moments of plate
motions from tectonic reconstructions extended back to the early

convergence in eastern Asia and quadrupole divergence in both

nearly identical to the dipole and quadrupole orientations of
underlying mantle flow, which indicates that these 'net

The positions of quadrupole divergence have not moved

long-term stability of mantle upwelling beneath Africa and the

author="{\v C}{\'\i}{\v z}kov{\'a}, Hana and Bina, Craig R",
abstract="An endothermic phase transition in mantle material at 660-km
depth constitutes a barrier that in most cases prevents the
direct penetration of subducted slabs. Seismic tomography shows
that subducted material is in many subduction zones trapped at
the bottom of the transition zone, just above the 660-km phase
boundary. Recent tomographic models however also report
subducted material that penetrates to the shallow lower mantle,
and there it is observed to flatten at about 1000-km depth.
Models of slab dynamics that generally assume sharp rheological
transition at 660-km depth, however, mostly predict slab
stagnation at the bottom of the transition zone. Multiple lines
of evidence, including recent experiments, indicate that
viscosity may gradually increase in the uppermost ∼300 km of the
lower mantle, rather than simply changing abruptly at the
upper-lower mantle boundary. Here we present the results of a
modeling study focused on the effects of rheological transition
between upper and lower mantle material on slab deformation and
stagnation. We test the effects of smoothing the viscosity
increase over 300 km and shifting it to a depth of 1000 km or
even deeper. We show that slab ability to penetrate to the lower
mantle is mainly controlled by the trench migration rate, which
in turn is affected by crustal viscosity. Coupling between the
subducting and overriding plates thus plays a key role in
controlling slab penetration to the lower mantle and stagnation
in the deep transition zone or shallow lower mantle. Models with
strong crust and consequently negligible rollback display
penetration to the lower mantle without much hindrance and no
stagnation above or below the 660-km interface, regardless of
viscosity stratification in the shallow lower mantle. Models
with weak crust are characterized by fast rollback, and
penetration is very limited as slabs buckle horizontally and
flatten above the 660-km boundary. Most interesting from the
point of view of shallow lower mantle stagnation are models with
intermediate crustal viscosity. Here rollback is efficient,
though slower than in weak-crust cases. Horizontally lying slab
segments are trapped in the transition zone if the sharp
viscosity increase occurs at 660 km, but shifting the viscosity
increase to 1000 km depth allows for efficient sinking of the
flat-lying part and results in temporary stagnation below the
upper-lower mantle boundary at about 1000 km depth.",

abstract="This study investigates the use of a previously published
algorithm for estimating ground heat flux (GHF) at the global
scale. The method is based on an analytical solution of the
diffusion equation for heat transfer in a soil layer and has
been shown to be effective at the point scale. The algorithm has
several advantageous properties: 1) it only needs a single-level
input of surface (skin) temperature, 2) the time-mean GHF can be
derived directly from time-mean skin temperature, 3) it has
reduced sensitivity to the variability in soil thermal
properties and moisture, 4) it does not requires snow depth, and
5) it is computationally effective. A global map of the
necessary thermal inertia parameter is derived using reanalysis
data as a function of soil type. These parameter estimates are
comparable to values obtained from in situ observations. The new
global GHF estimates are generally consistent with the
reanalysis GHF output simulated using two-layer soil hydrology
models. The authors argue that the new algorithm is more robust
and trustworthy in regions where they differ. The proposed
algorithm offers potential benefits for direct assimilation of
observations of surface temperature as well as GHF into the
reanalysis models at various time scales. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

abstract="The association of deep-sea trenches--steeply angled, planar
zones where earthquakes occur deep into Earth's interior--and
chains, or arcs, of active, explosive volcanoes had been
recognized for 90 years prior to the development of plate
tectonic theory in the 1960s. Oceanic lithosphere is created at
mid-ocean ridge spreading centers and recycled into the mantle at
subduction zones, where down-going lithospheric plates
dynamically sustain the deep-sea trenches. Study of subduction
zone initiation is a challenge because evidence of the processes
involved is typically destroyed or buried by later tectonic and
crust-forming events. In 2014 and 2017, the International Ocean
Discovery Program (IODP) specifically targeted these processes
with three back-toback expeditions to the archetypal
Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) intra-oceanic arcs and one expedition to
the Tonga-Kermadec (TK) system. Both subduction systems were
initiated ~52 million years ago, coincident with a proposed major
change of Pacific plate motion. These expeditions explored the
tectonism preceding and accompanying subduction initiation and
the characteristics of the earliest crust-forming magmatism. Lack
of compressive uplift in the overriding plate combined with
voluminous basaltic seafloor magmatism in an extensional
environment indicates a large component of spontaneous subduction
initiation was involved for the IBM. Conversely, a complex range
of far-field uplift and depression accompanied the birth of the
TK system, indicative of a more distal forcing of subduction
initiation. Future scientific ocean drilling is needed to target
the three-dimensional aspects of these processes at new
converging margins. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

abstract="Abstract We use a suite of 3-D numerical experiments to test and
expand 2-D planar isoviscous scaling relationships of Moore
(2008) for mixed heating convection in spherical geometry mantles
over a range of Rayleigh numbers (Ra). The internal temperature
scaling of Moore (2008), when modified to account for spherical
geometry, matches our experimental results to a high degree of
fit. The heat flux through the boundary layers scale as a linear
combination of internal (Q) and basal heating, and the modified
theory predictions match our experimental results. Our results
indicate that boundary layer thickness and surface heat flux are
not controlled by a local boundary layer stability condition (in
agreement with the results of Moore (2008)) and are instead
strongly influenced by boundary layer interactions. Subadiabatic
mantle temperature gradients, in spherical 3-D, are well
described by a vertical velocity scaling based on discrete drips
as opposed to a scaling based on coherent sinking sheets, which
was found to describe 2-D planar results. Root-mean-square (RMS)
velocities are asymptotic for both low Q and high Q, with a
region of rapid adjustment between asymptotes for moderate Q. RMS
velocities are highest in the low Q asymptote and decrease as
internal heating is applied. The scaling laws derived by Moore
(2008), and extended here, are robust and highlight the
importance of differing boundary layer processes acting over

Implications for predictions of planetary evolution",

abstract="Solid-state thermal convection, as a model for the internal
dynamics of planetary mantles, is generated both by volumetric
heating and heating from below. A series of 2D and 3D numerical
experiments is described where a bottom heat flux is prescribed
as well as a constant fraction of volumetric heating with either
free-slip or no-slip conditions for the two horizontal
boundaries. The assumption that hot plumes rising in the interior
of the layer act as a volumetric heat source leads to a first
order scaling of thermal boundary layers. Cases with a no-slip
boundary agree well with this scaling while cases with free-slip
systematically deviate: a decrease of 20--30\% is observed for
the temperature difference across the boundary layer when the
fraction of heating from below is increased from 0 to 1. These
differences are attributable to a velocity structure near the
boundary varying with the fraction of volumetric heating. The
main planetary implications are that (i) the average thermal
structure of the bulk mantle and lithosphere are not good
indicators of the distribution of heat sources between the
interior (e.g. radioactive heating, secular cooling) and the
lower interface (e.g. core cooling); (ii) in contrast, the nature

a wide range of terrestrial mass (size) planets around their
host stars. In this letter, we present estimates of
habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective
temperatures in the range 2600 K - 7200 K, for planetary
masses between 0.1 ME and 5 ME. Assuming H2O (inner HZ) and
CO2 (outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and scaling the
background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the
planet, our results indicate that larger planets have wider
HZs than do smaller ones. Specifically, with the assumption
that smaller planets will have less dense atmospheres, the
inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves
outward (~10\% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets
due to larger greenhouse effect arising from the increased
H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O column depth
is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water
vapor completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation.
Hence the inner edge moves inward (7\% higher than Earth's
flux). The outer HZ changes little due to the competing
effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo.
New, 3-D climate model results from other groups are also
summarized, and we argue that further, independent studies
are needed to verify their predictions. Combined with our

abstract="The tectonic style and viability of modern plate tectonics in the
early Earth is still debated. Field observations and theoretical
arguments both in favor and against the uniformitarian view of
plate tectonics back until the Archean continue to accumulate.
Here, we present the first numerical modeling results that
address for a hotter Earth the viability of subduction, one of
the main requirements for plate tectonics. A hotter mantle has
mainly two effects: 1) viscosity is lower, and 2) more melt is
produced, which in a plate tectonic setting will lead to a
thicker oceanic crust and harzburgite layer. Although
compositional buoyancy resulting from these thick crust and
harzburgite might be a serious limitation for subduction
initiation, our modeling results show that eclogitization
significantly relaxes this limitation for a developed, ongoing
subduction process. Furthermore, the lower viscosity leads to
more frequent slab breakoff, and sometimes to crustal separation
from the mantle lithosphere. Unlike earlier propositions, not
compositional buoyancy considerations, but this lithospheric
weakness could be the principle limitation to the viability of
plate tectonics in a hotter Earth. These results suggest a new
explanation for the absence of ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism
(UHPM) and blueschists in most of the Precambrian: early slabs
were not too buoyant, but too weak to provide a mechanism for
UHPM and exhumation.",

on Earth, but its emergence and evolution remain unclear. Here we
extrapolate models of present-day plate tectonics to the past and
propose that since about three billion years ago the rise of
continents and the accumulation of sediments at continental edges
and in trenches has provided lubrication for the stabilization of
subduction and has been crucial in the development of plate
tectonics on Earth. We conclude that the two largest surface
erosion and subduction lubrication events occurred after the
Palaeoproterozoic Huronian global glaciations (2.45 to 2.2
billion years ago), leading to the formation of the Columbia
supercontinent, and after the Neoproterozoic `snowball' Earth
glaciations (0.75 to 0.63 billion years ago). The snowball Earth
event followed the `boring billion'---a period of reduced plate
tectonic activity about 1.75 to 0.75 billion years ago that was
probably caused by a shortfall of sediments in trenches---and it

structure of icy moons and dwarf planets thus requires an
accurate description of stagnant lid convection. We performed
numerical experiments of stagnant lid convection in 3-D spherical

derived scaling laws for the average temperature of the

the shell. The nondimensional temperature difference across the
bottom thermal boundary layer is well described by , where ? is a
parameter that controls the magnitude of the viscosity contrast.
The nondimensional heat flux at the bottom of the shell, Fbot,
scales as . Our models also show that the development of the
stagnant lid regime depends on f. For given values of Ram and ??,
the stagnant lid is less developed as the shell's curvature

of 0.11--0.88. The critical Rayleigh number Rc for the onset of
thermal convection decreases by two orders of magnitude as f
increases from 0.11 to 0.88, when the viscosity depends
sensitively on the temperature, as is the case for real mantle
materials. Numerical simulations carried out in the range of f =
0.11--0.55 show that a thermal boundary layer (TBL) develops
both along the surface and bottom boundaries to induce cold and
hot plumes, respectively, when f is 0.33 or larger. However, for
smaller f values, a TBL develops only on the bottom boundary.
Convection occurs in the stagnant-lid regime where the root mean
square velocity on the surface boundary is less than 1 per cent
of its maximum at depth, when the ratio of the viscosity at the
surface boundary to that at the bottom boundary exceeds a
threshold that depends on f. The threshold decreases from 106.5

models that incorporate cyclic changes from stagnant lid to
mobile lid tectonics. A large part of the geologic record is
missing for the times at which several of these cycles are
inferred to have taken place. The cratons, however, are likely to
retain important clues relating to similar cycles developed in
the Mesoarchean and Neoarchean. Widespread acceptance of a form
of plate tectonics by ∼3.2 Ga is not at odds with the sporadic
occurrence of stagnant lid tectonics after this time. The concept
of scale as applied to cratons, mantle plumes and Neoarchean
volcanic arcs are likely to provide important constraints on
future models of Earth's geodynamic evolution. The Superior
Province will provide some of the most concrete evidence in this
regard given that its constituent blocks may have been locked
into a stagnant lid relatively soon after their formation and
then assembled in the next global plate tectonic interval.
Perceived complexities associated with inferred mantle plume --
volcanic arc associations in the Superior Province and other
cratons may be related to an over estimation of plume size. A
possible stagnant lid episode between ∼2.9 Ga and ∼2.8 Ga is
identified by previously unexplained lapses in volcanism on
cratons, including the Kaapvaal, Yilgarn and Superior Province
cratons. If real, then mantle dynamics associated with this

following: (1) increasing proportion of basalts with ``arc-like''
mantle sources; (2) an increasing abundance of basalts derived
from enriched (EM) and depleted (DM) mantle sources; (3) onset of
a Great Thermal Divergence in the mantle; (4) a decrease in

author="Stern, Robert J and Gerya, Taras and Tackley, Paul J",
abstract="To better understand Earth's present tectonic style--plate
tectonics--and how it may have evolved from single plate
(stagnant lid) tectonics, it is instructive to consider how
common it is among similar bodies in the Solar System. Plate
tectonics is a style of convection for an active planetoid where
lid fragment (plate) motions reflect sinking of dense lithosphere
in subduction zones, causing upwelling of asthenosphere at
divergent plate boundaries and accompanied by focused upwellings,
or mantle plumes; any other tectonic style is usefully called
``stagnant lid'' or ``fragmented lid''. In 2015 humanity
completed a 50+ year effort to survey the 30 largest planets,
asteroids, satellites, and inner Kuiper Belt objects, which we
informally call ``planetoids'' and use especially images of these
bodies to infer their tectonic activity. The four largest
planetoids are enveloped in gas and ice (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune) and are not considered. The other 26 planetoids
range in mass over 5 orders of magnitude and in diameter over 2
orders of magnitude, from massive Earth down to tiny Proteus;
these bodies also range widely in density, from 1000 to 5500
kg/m3. A gap separates 8 silicate planetoids with $\rho$ = 3000
kg/m3 or greater from 20 icy planetoids (including the gaseous
and icy giant planets) with $\rho$ = 2200 kg/m3 or less. We
define the ``Tectonic Activity Index'' (TAI), scoring each body
from 0 to 3 based on evidence for recent volcanism, deformation,
and resurfacing (inferred from impact crater density). Nine
planetoids with TAI = 2 or greater are interpreted to be
tectonically and convectively active whereas 17 with TAI <2 are
inferred to be tectonically dead. We further infer that active
planetoids have lithospheres or icy shells overlying
asthenosphere or water/weak ice. TAI of silicate (rocky)
planetoids positively correlates with their inferred Rayleigh
number. We conclude that some type of stagnant lid tectonics is
the dominant mode of heat loss and that plate tectonics is
unusual. To make progress understanding Earth's tectonic history
and the tectonic style of active exoplanets, we need to better
understand the range and controls of active stagnant lid

dense atmosphere. Its near-random distribution of impact craters
led to the inferences of episodic global resurfacing and a
stagnant lid regime, and imply that it is not currently able to
lose proportionately as much heat as Earth. This paper shows that
a CO2-induced asthenosphere and decoupling of the mantle lid from
the crust, caused by the elevated surface temperature, enables
lid rejuvenation. Global hypsography implies a rate of
4·0$\pm$0·5km²a−1 and an implied heat loss rate of
32·8$\pm$3·6TW, ~90\% of a scaled Earth-like rate of heat loss of
36TW. Estimates of the rate of lid rejuvenation by plume activity
-- 0·07 to 0·09km²a−1-- imply that ten times the number of
observed plumes are required to equal this rate of heat loss.
However, lid rejuvenation by convection allows Venus to maintain
a stable tectonic regime, with subcrustal horizontal extension
(half-spreading) rates of between 25 and 50mma−1 determined from
fits to topographic profiles across the principal rift systems.

the cooling of planets have mainly been derived from steady-state
convection models. Here, fully dynamic 2-D and 3-D models are
employed to compute the interior thermal evolution using strong
temperature-dependent viscosity, mixed heating with radioelement
decay, spherical geometry. The results of these models are
compared to those of parametrized models, where we distinguish
between the upper thermal boundary layer (TBL) and the stagnant
lid, in a Monte Carlo framework to derive scaling laws valid for
the entire planet evolution. The upper TBL thickness depends on
the Rayleigh number to the power $\beta$u, while the lid base is
determined by the mantle temperature and the rate of viscosity
change with temperature multiplied by a prefactor arh. By varying
$\beta$u and arh we find that, although the heating conditions
change as a function of time, the thermal evolution of a cooling
planet in a stagnant lid regime can be represented by a wide
range of combinations of arh and $\beta$u. Suitable fits are
found for different values of arh and $\beta$u that vary
depending on the model set-up. The observed relationship between
suitable values of arh and $\beta$u is explained by a trade-off
between the lid and the TBL thicknesses. Only when considering a
specific definition of the stagnant lid thickness in 3-D
simulations, suitable combinations for all models converge to
specific values of arh and $\beta$u. Using a stagnant lid defined

that the non-dimensional temperature jump across the bottom

(1-$\vartheta$m)=1.23($\Delta$Tv/$\Delta$T), where $\vartheta$m
is the non-dimensional average temperature of the convective

defined as the inverse of the logarithmic temperature derivative
of viscosity. Due to the presence of the stagnant lid at the top

heat flux is much lower than those of the bottom heat flux. The
Nusselt number, measuring the heat transfer, is well explain by
Nu=1.46Ram0.270($\Delta$Tv/$\Delta$T)1.21, where Ram is the

their outer ice I shell, the heat transfer through these shells,

by magmatism affects the lunar mantle evolution depending on the
initial condition, I present two-dimensional numerical models of
magmatism in convecting mantle internally heated by incompatible
HPEs. Mantle convection occurs beneath a stagnant lithosphere
that inhibits recycling of the HPE-enriched crustal materials to
the mantle. Magmatism is modeled by a permeable flow of magma
generated by decompression melting through matrix. Migrating
magma transports heat, mass, and HPEs. When the deep mantle is
initially hot with the temperature TD around 1800 K at its base,
magmatism starts from the beginning of the calculated history to
extract HPEs from the mantle. The mantle is monotonously cooled,
and magmatism ceases within 2 Gyr, accordingly. When the deep
mantle is initially colder with TD around 1100 K, HPEs stay in
the deep mantle for a longer time to let the planet be first
heated up and then cooled only slightly. If, in addition, there
is an HPE-enriched domain in the shallow mantle at the beginning
of the calculation, magma continues ascending to the surface
through the domain for more than 3 Gyr. The low TD models fit in
with the thermal and magmatic history of the Moon inferred from
spacecraft observations, although it is not clear if the models

abstract="Planetary mantles and solid shells of icy satellites potentially
undergoing natural convection are subjected to a mixed heating
configuration including basal (from thermal exchanges with a
subjacent, possibly liquid, layer) and internal (from radioactive
decay or tidal dissipation) sources. In the quasi-static
approximation, the average cooling/heating of the layer is also
considered as an instantaneous internal heat source to model
transient evolutions. In a previous study (Choblet and
Parmentier, 2009), we have proposed simple scaling relationships
to describe heat transfer for an isoviscous fluid in such a mixed
heating configuration in the case of a Cartesian geometry. Here,
we extend this analysis to the case of a spherical shell. A
framework based on a temperature scale associated with the global
surface heat flux is introduced. This enables a simple
description of the cold boundary layer, independent of the
heating configuration and of the relative radius of the inner
boundary of the shell. When free-slip mechanical boundaries are
prescribed, numerical experiments present a significant departure
from the prediction (up to ≃30\%). We show that this is caused by
the impact of hot plumes on the cold boundary layer when a large
amount of basal heating is prescribed. The results of no-slip
calculations are well predicted by the scaling which thus could
be applied to planetary mantles where convection occurs beneath a
rigid lithosphere. The lower hot boundary layer is included in
our analysis through the ratio of the temperature differences
across both boundary layers: the simple scaling indicates that
this ratio is independent of the Rayleigh number, and varies only
with the amount of basal heating and with the curvature of the
layer. This is shown to be valid in the no-slip case. In the
free-slip case, a departure from this scaling is observed in the
calculations but for the range of values corresponding to
planetary bodies, the agreement is good. We conduct transient
numerical experiments and show that the quasi-static

abstract="Abstract Convection in terrestrial bodies occurs within spherical
shells described by the ratio, f, of their bounding radii.
Previous studies that have modeled convection with a
temperature-dependent viscosity noted the strong effect of f on
transition to the stagnant-lid regime. Here we analyze
stagnant-lid convection in 2-D and 3-D systems with curvatures
including relatively small-core shells (f as small as 0.2) as
well as in thin shell and plane-layer cases. Several
peculiarities of convection in a strongly temperature-dependent
viscosity fluid are identified for both high and low curvature
systems. We demonstrate that effective Rayleigh numbers may
differ by orders of magnitude in systems with different
curvatures, when all other parameters are maintained at fixed
values. Furthermore, as f is decreased, the nature of
stagnant-lid convection in small-core bodies shows a divergence
in the temperature and velocity fields found for 2-D annulus and
3-D spherical shell systems. In addition, substantial differences
in the behavior of thin shell (f = 0.9) and plane-layer
(Cartesian geometry) models occur in both 2-D and 3-D, indicating
that the latter (emulating a toroidal topology rather than
spherical) may be inappropriate approximations for modeling
variable viscosity convection in thin spherical shells. Our
findings are especially relevant to understanding and accurately
modeling the thermal structure that may exist in bodies
characterized by thin shells (e.g., f = 0.9) or relatively small
cores, such as shells comprising the Galilean satellites and
other moons.",

mantle convection",
author="H{\"u}ttig, Christian and Breuer, Doris",
abstract="Internally heated 3-D mantle convection models in a spherical
shell with temperature and pressure dependent viscosity have been
performed to provide new insights into the various convection
regimes, the transition from steady state convection to
time-dependent convection and the associated convection pattern.
The analysis of a total of 91 simulations reveals four regime
types, i.e., a mobile-lid regime, a sluggish regime, a low-degree
regime, and a stagnant-lid regime. The occurrence of these
regimes depends on the viscosity contrast and the internal
Rayleigh number. The low-degree regime occurs close to the
boundary of the stagnant-lid regime in case of temperature
dependent viscosity. In case of additional pressure dependence,
the range of the low-degree regime is smaller and a narrow range
of the sluggish-lid regime exists in the weakly convecting part.
Furthermore, the transition to the stagnant-lid regime occurs at
a lower viscosity contrast. For the stagnant-lid regime we have
derived a scaling law describing the heat transport. Similar
scalings could not be obtained for the other regimes as this
seems to require also a correlation of the convective pattern
with the internal Rayleigh number. Such a relation is only given
for the stagnant-lid regime in case of 3D spherical geometry. The
stagnant-lid cases in steady state show a minimal possible degree
of the convective pattern that is independent on the pressure
dependence of viscosity and remains constant until time-dependent
convection sets in with increasing Ra. At this stage, the
dominant degree of the convective pattern increases with
increasing internal Ra but the slope varies with the pressure
dependence of the viscosity.",

Rayleigh number for the onset of convection is determined as a
function of roll dimension and degree of curvature. At high
Rayleigh numbers the Nusselt number and mean temperature in
vigorously convecting cylindrical shells are determined as
functions of roll dimension and degree of curvature. It is
demonstrated that comparisons between model results at different

author="Li, Mingming and Zhong, Shijie",
abstract="Mantle plumes are thought to originate from thermal boundary
layers such as Earth's core-mantle boundary (CMB), and may cause
intraplate volcanism such as large igneous provinces (LIPs) on
the Earth's surface. Previous studies showed that the original
eruption sites of deep-sourced LIPs for the last 200 Myrs occur
mostly above the margins of the seismically-observed large low
shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lowermost mantle.
However, the mechanism that leads to the distribution of the LIPs
is not clear. The location of the LIPs is largely determined by
the source location of mantle plumes, but the question is under
what conditions mantle plumes form outside, at the edges, or
above the middle of LLSVPs. Here, we perform 3D geodynamic
calculations and theoretical analyses to study the plume source
location in the lowermost mantle. We find that a factor of five
decrease of thermal expansivity and a factor of two increase of
thermal diffusivity from the surface to the CMB, which are
consistent with mineral physics studies, significantly reduce the
number of mantle plumes forming far outside of thermochemical
piles (i.e., LLSVPs). An increase of mantle viscosity in the
lowermost mantle also reduces number of plumes far outside of
piles. In addition, we find that strong plumes preferentially
form at/near the edges of piles and are generally hotter than
that forming on top of piles, which may explain the observations
that most LIPs occur above LLSVP margins. However, some plumes
originated at pile edges can later appear above the middle of
piles due to lateral movement of the plumes and piles and
morphologic changes of the piles. ∼65--70\% strong plumes are
found within 10 degrees from pile edges in our models. Although
plate motion exerts significant controls over the large-scale
mantle convection in the lower mantle, mantle plume formation at
the CMB remains largely controlled by thermal boundary layer
instability which makes it difficult to predict geographic
locations of most mantle plumes. However, all our models show
consistently strong plumes originating from the lowermost mantle
beneath Iceland, supporting a deep mantle plume origin of the

abstract="Earth's continents drift in response to the force balance between
mantle flow and plate tectonics and actively change the
plate-mantle coupling. Thus, the patterns of continental drift
provide relevant information on the coupled evolution of surface
tectonics, mantle structure and dynamics. Here, we investigate
rheological controls on such evolutions and use surface tectonic
patterns to derive inferences on mantle viscosity structure on
Earth. We employ global spherical models of mantle convection
featuring self-consistently generated plate tectonics, which are
used to compute time-evolving continental configurations for
different mantle and lithosphere structures. Our results
highlight the importance of the wavelength of mantle flow for
continental configuration evolution. Too strong short-wavelength
components complicate the aggregation of large continental
clusters, while too stable very long wavelength flow tends to
enforce compact supercontinent clustering without reasonable
dispersal frequencies. Earth-like continental drift with episodic
collisions and dispersals thus requires a viscosity structure
that supports long-wavelength flow, but also allows for
shorter-wavelength contributions. Such a criterion alone is a
rather permissive constraint on internal structure, but it can be
improved by considering continental-oceanic plate speed ratios
and the toroidal-poloidal partitioning of plate motions. The best
approximation of Earth's recent tectonic evolution is then
achieved with an intermediate lithospheric yield stress and a
viscosity structure in which oceanic plates are ∼ 103 $\times$
more viscous than the characteristic upper mantle, which itself
is ∼ 100--200 $\times$ less viscous than the lowermost mantle.
Such a structure causes continents to move on average ∼ (2.2
$\pm$ 1.0) $\times$ slower than oceanic plates, consistent with
estimates from present-day and from plate reconstructions. This
does not require a low viscosity asthenosphere globally extending
below continental roots. However, this plate speed ratio may
undergo strong fluctuations on timescales of several 100Myr that
may be linked to periods of enhanced continental collisions and
are not yet captured by current tectonic reconstructions.",

decreasing f leads to an asymmetry in the distribution of normal

here, this asymmetry results in a maximum normal stress at the
lower boundary which exceeds that at the upper boundary by about
60\% for values of f appropriate to the whole mantle. Thus,

used the anelastic liquid approximation with Earth-like material
parameters. The usual variable-viscosity approach in
mantle-convection models is the assumption of a temperature
dependence only. The resulting thermal boundary layers are
included in our model also, but an additional viscosity profile
of the interior mantle was derived: The Birch--Murnaghan equation
was employed to derive the Gr{\"u}neisen parameter and other
physical quantities as a function of depth from observational
values provided by PREM. We computed the melting temperature and
a new mantle viscosity profile, called eta3, using the
Gr{\"u}neisen parameter, Lindemann's law and some solid-state
physics considerations. The new features of eta3 are a
high-viscosity transition layer with rather high viscosity
gradients at its boundaries, a second low-viscosity layer
beginning under the 660-km discontinuity, and a strong viscosity
increase in the central parts of the lower mantle. The rheology
is Newtonian but it is supplemented by a viscoplastic yield
stress, $\sigma$y. A viscosity-level parameter, rn, and $\sigma$y
have been varied. For a medium-sized
Rayleigh-number--yield-stress area, eta3 generates a stable,
plate-tectonic behavior near the surface and simultaneously thin
sheet-like downwellings in the depth. Outside this area, three
other types of solution were found. Not only the planforms but
also the evolution of the Rayleigh number, the reciprocal Urey
number, the Nusselt number, the surface heat flow, etc., have

different basic viscosity profiles, etaKL5a and etaKM, of other

generation of surface plates and thin sheet-like downwellings in
the depth considerably more than etaKL5a or even etaKM. The
presence of two internal low-viscosity layers is obviously
conducive for plateness and thin sheet-like downwellings. For an

mantle solidus and liquidus reach 4150 ($\pm$150) K and 4725
($\pm$150) K, respectively. We discuss that the lower mantle is
unlikely to melt in the D″-layer, except if the highest estimate
of the temperature profile at the base of the mantle, which is
associated with a very hot core, is confirmed. Therefore, recent
suggestions of partial melting in the lowermost mantle based on
seismic observations of ultra-low velocity zones indicate either
(1) a outer core exceeding 4150K at the CMB or (2) the presence
of chemical heterogeneities with high concentration of fusible
elements. Our observations of a high liquidus temperature as well
as a large gap between solidus and liquidus temperatures have
important implications for the properties of the magma ocean
during accretion. Not only complete melting of the lower mantle
would require excessively high temperatures, but also, below
liquidus temperatures partial melting should take place over a
much larger depth interval than previously thought. In addition,
magma adiabats suggest very high surface temperatures in case of
a magma ocean that would extend to more than 40GPa, as suggested
by siderophile metal--silicate partitioning data. Such high
surface temperature regime, where thermal blanketing is
inefficient, points out to a transient character of the magma
ocean, with a very fast cooling rate.",

The dominant role of thermal heterogeneity",

abstract="Two large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the deep
mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific are generally interpreted
as hot but chemically dense `piles', which have remained isolated
from mantle circulation for several hundred million years. This
interpretation largely hinges on four seismic observations: (i)
their shear wave velocity anomalies are considered too large for
purely thermal structures; (ii) shear wave velocity gradients at
their edges are sharp; (iii) their shear to compressional
wave-speed anomaly ratios are high; and (iv) their shear and
bulk-sound velocity anomalies appear to be anti-correlated.
However, using compressible global mantle circulation models
driven by 300Myr of plate motion history and thermodynamic
methods for converting from physical to seismic structure, we
show that observed lower mantle shear wave velocity anomalies do
not require, and are most likely incompatible with, large-scale
chemical `piles'. A prescribed core-mantle-boundary temperature
of 4000K, which is consistent with current estimates, combined
with anelastic seismic sensitivity to temperature, ensures that
purely thermal LLSVPs, strongly focussed beneath Africa and the
Pacific by subduction history, can reconcile observed shear wave
velocity anomalies and gradients. By contrast, shear wave
velocity anomalies from models that include dense chemical
`piles' at the base of Earth's mantle, where `piles' correspond
to only 3\% of the mantle's volume, are substantially stronger
than the tomographic model S40RTS, even after accounting for
limited tomographic resolution. Our results also suggest that in
the presence of post-perovskite, elevated ratios between shear
and compressional wave-speed anomalies and the correlation
between shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies cannot be used to
discriminate between thermal and compositional heterogeneity at
depth: in all calculations, an anti-correlation only occurs
within the post-perovskite stability field. Taken together, this
implies that although there must be considerable chemical
heterogeneity within Earth's mantle, large, coherent `piles' are
not required to reconcile the seismic observations examined here.
Indeed, our results suggest that if chemical heterogeneity is
present in these regions, its dynamical and seismic significance
is far less than has previously been inferred.",

mobile lid convection: Importance of grainsize evolution",
author="Foley, Bradford J and Rizo, Hanika",
abstract="The style of tectonics on the Hadean and Archean Earth,
particularly whether plate tectonics was in operation or not, is
debated. One important, albeit indirect, constraint on early
Earth tectonics comes from observations of early-formed
geochemical heterogeneities: 142Nd and 182W anomalies recorded in
Hadean to Phanerozoic rocks from different localities indicate
that chemically heterogeneous reservoirs, formed during the first
∼500 Myrs of Earth's history, survived their remixing into the
mantle for over 1 Gyrs. Such a long mixing time is difficult to
explain because hotter mantle temperatures, expected for the
early Earth, act to lower mantle viscosity and increase
convective vigor. Previous studies found that mobile lid
convection typically erases heterogeneity within ∼100 Myrs under
such conditions, leading to the hypothesis that stagnant lid
convection on the early Earth was responsible for the observed
long mixing times. However, using two-dimensional Cartesian
convection models that include grainsize evolution, we find that
mobile lid convection can preserve heterogeneity at high mantle
temperature conditions for much longer than previously thought,
because higher mantle temperatures lead to larger grainsizes in
the lithosphere. These larger grainsizes result in stronger plate
boundaries that act to slow down surface and interior convective
motions, in competition with the direct effect temperature has on
mantle viscosity. Our models indicate that mobile lid convection
can preserve heterogeneity for $\approx$0.4--1 Gyrs at early
Earth mantle temperatures when the initial heterogeneity has the
same viscosity as the background mantle, and $\approx$1--4 Gyrs
when the heterogeneity is ten times more viscous than the
background mantle. Thus, stagnant lid convection is not required
to explain long-term survival of early formed geochemical
heterogeneities, though these heterogeneities having an elevated
viscosity compared to the surrounding mantle may be essential for
their preservation.",

there is no evidence that $\beta$ changes at high Ra. Therefore,

our simulations, warm intrusive magmatism acts to thin the
lithosphere, leading to sustained recycling of overlying crustal
material and cooling of the mantle. In contrast, volcanic
eruptions lead to a thick lithosphere that insulates the upper
mantle and prevents efficient cooling. We find that heat loss due
to intrusive magmatism can be particularly efficient compared to
volcanic eruptions if the partitioning of heat-producing

author="Korenaga, Jun",
abstract="Resolving the modes of mantle convection through Earth history,
i.e. when plate tectonics started and what kind of mantle
dynamics reigned before, is essential to the understanding of the
evolution of the whole Earth system, because plate tectonics
influences almost all aspects of modern geological processes.
This is a challenging problem because plate tectonics
continuously rejuvenates Earth's surface on a time scale of about
100 Myr, destroying evidence for its past operation. It thus
becomes essential to exploit indirect evidence preserved in the
buoyant continental crust, part of which has survived over
billions of years. This contribution starts with an in-depth
review of existing models for continental growth. Growth models
proposed so far can be categorized into three types: crust-based,
mantle-based and other less direct inferences, and the first two
types are particularly important as their difference reflects the
extent of crustal recycling, which can be related to subduction.
Then, a theoretical basis for a change in the mode of mantle
convection in the Precambrian is reviewed, along with a critical
appraisal of some popular notions for early Earth dynamics. By
combining available geological and geochemical observations with
geodynamical considerations, a tentative hypothesis is presented
for the evolution of mantle dynamics and its relation to surface
environment; the early onset of plate tectonics and gradual
mantle hydration are responsible not only for the formation of
continental crust but also for its preservation as well as its
emergence above sea level. Our current understanding of various
material properties and elementary processes is still too
premature to build a testable, quantitative model for this
hypothesis, but such modelling efforts could potentially
transform the nature of the data-starved early Earth research by
quantifying the extent of preservation bias.This article is part

abstract="Less than 25\% of the volume of the juvenile continental crust
preserved today is older than 3 Ga, there are no known rocks
older than approximately 4 Ga, and yet a number of recent models
of continental growth suggest that at least 60-80\% of the
present volume of the continental crust had been generated by 3
Ga. Such models require that large volumes of pre-3 Ga crust were
destroyed and replaced by younger crust since the late Archaean.
To address this issue, we evaluate the influence on the rock
record of changing the rates of generation and destruction of the
continental crust at different times in Earth's history. We
adopted a box model approach in a numerical model constrained by
the estimated volumes of continental crust at 3 Ga and the
present day, and by the distribution of crust formation ages in
the present-day crust. The data generated by the model suggest
that new continental crust was generated continuously, but with a
marked decrease in the net growth rate at approximately 3 Ga
resulting in a temporary reduction in the volume of continental
crust at that time. Destruction rates increased dramatically
around 3 billion years ago, which may be linked to the widespread
development of subduction zones. The volume of continental crust
may have exceeded its present value by the mid/late Proterozoic.
In this model, about 2.6-2.3 times of the present volume of
continental crust has been generated since Earth's formation, and
approximately 1.6-1.3 times of this volume has been destroyed and

abstract="The secular evolution of the Earth's crust is marked by a
profound change in average crustal chemistry between 3.2 and 2.5
Ga. A key marker for this change is the transition from Archaean
sodic granitoid intrusions of the
tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) series to potassic (K)
granitic suites, akin (but not identical) to I-type granites that
today are associated with subduction zones. It remains poorly
constrained as to how and why this change was initiated and if it
holds clues about the geodynamic transition from a pre-plate
tectonic mode, often referred to as stagnant lid, to mobile plate
tectonics. Here, we combine a series of proposed mechanisms for
Archaean crustal geodynamics in a single model to explain the
observed change in granitoid chemistry. Numeric modelling
indicates that upper mantle convection drives crustal flow and
subsidence, leading to profound diversity in lithospheric
thickness with thin versus thick proto-plates. When convecting
asthenospheric mantle interacts with lower lithosphere, scattered
crustal drips are created. Under increasing P-T conditions,
partial melting of hydrated meta-basalt within these drips
produces felsic melts that intrude the overlying crust to form
TTG. Dome structures, in which these melts can be preserved, are
a positive diapiric expression of these negative drips.
Transitional TTG with elevated K mark a second evolutionary
stage, and are blends of subsided and remelted older TTG forming
K-rich melts and new TTG melts. Ascending TTG-derived melts from
asymmetric drips interact with the asthenospheric mantle to form
hot, high-Mg sanukitoid. These melts are small in volume,
predominantly underplated, and their heat triggered melting of
lower crustal successions to form higher-K granites. Importantly,
this evolution operates as a disseminated process in space and
time over hundreds of millions of years (greater than 200 Ma) in
all cratons. This focused ageing of the crust implies that
compiled geochemical data can only broadly reflect geodynamic
changes on a global or even craton-wide scale. The observed

author="O'Neill, Craig and Turner, Simon and Rushmer, Tracy",
abstract="The development of plate tectonics from a pre-plate tectonics
regime requires both the initiation of subduction and the
development of nascent subduction zones into long-lived
contiguous features. Subduction itself has been shown to be
sensitive to system parameters such as thermal state and the
specific rheology. While generally it has been shown that
cold-interior high-Rayleigh-number convection (such as on the
Earth today) favours plates and subduction, due to the ability of
the interior stresses to couple with the lid, a given system may
or may not have plate tectonics depending on its initial
conditions. This has led to the idea that there is a strong
history dependence to tectonic evolution-and the details of
tectonic transitions, including whether they even occur, may
depend on the early history of a planet. However, intrinsic
convective stresses are not the only dynamic drivers of early
planetary evolution. Early planetary geological evolution is
dominated by volcanic processes and impacting. These have rarely
been considered in thermal evolution models. Recent models
exploring the details of plate tectonic initiation have explored
the effect of strong thermal plumes or large impacts on surface
tectonism, and found that these 'primary drivers' can initiate
subduction, and, in some cases, over-ride the initial state of
the planet. The corollary of this, of course, is that, in the
absence of such ongoing drivers, existing or incipient subduction
systems under early Earth conditions might fail. The only
detailed planetary record we have of this development comes from
Earth, and is restricted by the limited geological record of its
earliest history. Many recent estimates have suggested an origin
of plate tectonics at approximately 3.0 Ga, inferring a
monotonically increasing transition from pre-plates, through
subduction initiation, to continuous subduction and a modern
plate tectonic regime around that time. However, both numerical
modelling and the geological record itself suggest a strong
nonlinearity in the dynamics of the transition, and it has been
noted that the early history of Archaean greenstone belts and
trondhjemite-tonalite-granodiorite record many instances of
failed subduction. Here, we explore the history of subduction

title="The dependence of planetary tectonics on mantle thermal state:
applications to early Earth evolution",
author="Foley, Bradford J",
abstract="For plate tectonics to operate on a planet, mantle convective
forces must be capable of forming weak, localized shear zones in
the lithosphere that act as plate boundaries. Otherwise, a
planet's mantle will convect in a stagnant lid regime, where
subduction and plate motions are absent. Thus, when and how plate
tectonics initiated on the Earth is intrinsically tied to the
ability of mantle convection to form plate boundaries; however,
the physics behind this process are still uncertain. Most mantle
convection models have employed a simple pseudoplastic model of
the lithosphere, where the lithosphere 'fails' and develops a
mobile lid when stresses in the lithosphere reach the prescribed
yield stress. With pseudoplasticity high mantle temperatures and
high rates of internal heating, conditions relevant for the early
Earth, impede plate boundary formation by decreasing lithospheric
stresses, and hence favour a stagnant lid for the early Earth.
However, when a model for shear zone formation based on grain
size reduction is used, early Earth thermal conditions do not
favour a stagnant lid. While lithosphere stress drops with
increasing mantle temperature or heat production rate, the
deformational work, which drives grain size reduction, increases.
Thus, the ability of convection to form weak plate boundaries is
not impeded by early Earth thermal conditions. However, mantle
thermal state does change the style of subduction and lithosphere
mobility; high mantle temperatures lead to a more sluggish,
drip-like style of subduction. This 'sluggish lid' convection may
be able to explain many of the key observations of early Earth
crust formation processes preserved in the geologic record.
Moreover, this work highlights the importance of understanding
the microphysics of plate boundary formation for assessing early
Earth tectonics, as different plate boundary formation mechanisms
are influenced by mantle thermal state in fundamentally different
ways.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Earth

our planet, but estimates of how long it has been the modus
operandi of lithospheric formation and interactions range from
the Hadean to the Neoproterozoic. In this paper, we review
sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic proxies along with
palaeomagnetic data to infer both the development of rigid
lithospheric plates and their independent relative motion, and
conclude that significant changes in Earth behaviour occurred in
the mid- to late Archaean, between 3.2 Ga and 2.5 Ga. These data
include: sedimentary rock associations inferred to have
accumulated in passive continental margin settings, marking the
onset of sea-floor spreading; the oldest foreland basin deposits
associated with lithospheric convergence; a change from thin, new
continental crust of mafic composition to thicker crust of
intermediate composition, increased crustal reworking and the
emplacement of potassic and peraluminous granites, indicating
stabilization of the lithosphere; replacement of dome and keel
structures in granite-greenstone terranes, which relate to
vertical tectonics, by linear thrust imbricated belts; the
commencement of temporally paired systems of intermediate and
high dT/dP gradients, with the former interpreted to represent
subduction to collisional settings and the latter representing
possible hinterland back-arc settings or ocean plateau
environments. Palaeomagnetic data from the Kaapvaal and Pilbara
cratons for the interval 2780-2710 Ma and from the Superior,
Kaapvaal and Kola-Karelia cratons for 2700-2440 Ma suggest
significant relative movements. We consider these changes in the
behaviour and character of the lithosphere to be consistent with
a gestational transition from a non-plate tectonic mode, arguably
with localized subduction, to the onset of sustained plate
tectonics.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue

the prevailing geodynamic systems are highly uncertain due to the
sparse and complex nature of the geological record of these early

Venus' lack of plate tectonics and terrestrial surficial

sublithospheric flow processes related to a uniquely large super

tectonomagmatic activity, witnessed coupled spreading and
underthrusting, since arrested. These three tectonic regimes
provide possible analogue models for terrestrial Archaean craton
formation, continent formation without plate tectonics, and
mechanisms underlying the emergence of plate tectonics. A bolide

author="King, Scott D",
abstract="Abstract The primary explanations for the young crater age of the
surface of Venus are progressive volcanic resurfacing and a
period of mobile-lid tectonics. The role of initial conditions,
mantle potential temperature, and core potential temperature on
Venus surface mobility are explored using 3-D spherical mantle
convection calculations with a lithospheric yield stress that
allows the fluid to adopt either a stagnant or mobile lid. The
small offset between the center of mass and center of figure
(CM-CF) of Venus is reproduced in calculations that never undergo
a period of mobile-lid convection. The CM-CF offset has never
been used in the evaluation of geodynamic models for Venus. The
mobile-lid calculations have a CM-CF offset that is four times
the observed offset, and the offset increases significantly at
the onset of a mobile lid/resurfacing event. Furthermore, the
rapid increase in core mantle boundary heat flow that occurs as
the cold lithospheric material interacts with the core mantle
boundary during a mobile-lid event is sufficient to power a core
dynamo, even in the absence of inner core solidification. The
core mantle boundary heat flow decays over 1 Gyr after the
cessation of mobile-lid tectonics. The heat flow never reaches a
level that would power a thermally driven dynamo in calculations
that do not undergo mobile-lid convection. The calculations
indicate that Venus young surface age is not the result of a
mobile-lid resurfacing event while progressive resurfacing is
consistent with the observations.",

Africa and the Pacific Ocean are sometimes referred to as
``superplumes''. This name evokes images of large-scale active
upwellings. However, it remains unclear whether these features
are real or represent collections of multiple regular mantle
plumes. Here, we investigate the implications of these upwellings
for dynamic topography. We combine detailed measurements of
oceanic residual topography from Hoggard et al. (2016) with
continental constraints derived from CRUST1.0 to produce a global
model expanded in spherical harmonics. Observed dynamic
topography is subsequently compared to predictions derived from
mantle flow following Steinberger (2016) using tomographic
density models. Results yield relatively good overall agreement
and amplitude spectra with similar slopes, except for degree two
(i.e.>10,000km wavelengths) where predicted amplitude is more
than two times as large and is dominated by contributions from
the lower mantle. Predictive models suggest two large-scale
uplifted regions above the ``superplumes'' that are barely seen
in the observed topography. We suggest that this mismatch can
only partly be reconciled by altering the seismic velocity to
density conversion factor or by including the effects of lower
mantle chemical heterogeneity. In addition, it may be important
to consider more significant revisions to the lower mantle flow

the late Paleozoic Era",

M{\"u}ller, R Dietmar",
abstract="Detailed global plate motion models that provide a continuous
description of plate boundaries through time are an effective
tool for exploring processes both at and below the Earth's
surface. A new generation of numerical models of mantle dynamics
pre- and post-Pangea timeframes requires global kinematic
descriptions with full plate reconstructions extending into the
Paleozoic (410 Ma). Current plate models that cover Paleozoic
times are characterised by large plate speeds and trench
migration rates because they assume that lowermost mantle
structures are rigid and fixed through time. When used as a
surface boundary constraint in geodynamic models, these plate
reconstructions do not accurately reproduce the present-day
structure of the lowermost mantle. Building upon previous work,
we present a global plate motion model with continuously closing
plate boundaries ranging from the early Devonian at 410 Ma to
present day. We analyse the model in terms of surface kinematics
and predicted lower mantle structure. The magnitude of global
plate speeds has been greatly reduced in our reconstruction by
modifying the evolution of the synthetic Panthalassa oceanic
plates, implementing a Paleozoic reference frame independent of
any geodynamic assumptions, and implementing revised models for
the Paleozoic evolution of North and South China and the closure
of the Rheic Ocean. Paleozoic (410--250 Ma) RMS plate speeds are
on average ∼8 cm/yr, which is comparable to Mesozoic--Cenozoic
rates of ∼6 cm/yr on average. Paleozoic global median values of
trench migration trend from higher speeds (∼2.5 cm/yr) in the
late Devonian to rates closer to 0 cm/yr at the end of the
Permian (∼250 Ma), and during the Mesozoic--Cenozoic (250--0 Ma)
generally cluster tightly around ∼1.1 cm/yr. Plate motions are
best constrained over the past 130 Myr and calculations of global
trench convergence rates over this period indicate median rates
range between 3.2 cm/yr and 12.4 cm/yr with a present day median
rate estimated at ∼5 cm/yr. For Paleozoic times (410--251 Ma) our
model results in median convergence rates largely ∼5 cm/yr.
Globally, ∼90\% of subduction zones modelled in our
reconstruction are determined to be in a convergent regime for
the period of 120--0 Ma. Over the full span of the model, from
410 Ma to 0 Ma, ∼93\% of subduction zones are calculated to be
convergent, and at least 85\% of subduction zones are converging
for 97\% of modelled times. Our changes improve global plate and
trench kinematics since the late Paleozoic and our
reconstructions of the lowermost mantle structure challenge the
proposed fixity of lower mantle structures, suggesting that the
eastern margin of the African LLSVP margin has moved by as much
as ∼1450 km since late Permian times (260 Ma). The model of the
plate-mantle system we present suggests that during the Permian
Period, South China was proximal to the eastern margin of the
African LLSVP and not the western margin of the Pacific LLSVP as
previous thought.",

research with important implications for our understanding of
lithospheric strength, the driving force of plate tectonics, and
Earth's tectonic history. We are making good progress towards
understanding how new subduction zones form by combining field
studies to identify candidates and reconstruct their timing and
magmatic evolution and undertaking numerical modeling (informed
by rheological constraints) to test hypotheses. Here, we review
the state of the art by combining and comparing results coming
from natural observations and numerical models of SI. Two modes
of subduction initiation (SI) can be identified in both nature
and models, spontaneous and induced. Induced SI occurs when
pre-existing plate convergence causes a new subduction zone to
form whereas spontaneous SI occurs without pre-existing plate
motion when large lateral density contrasts occur across profound
lithospheric weaknesses of various origin. We have good natural
examples of 3 modes of subduction initiation, one type by induced
nucleation of a subduction zone (polarity reversal) and two types
of spontaneous nucleation of a subduction zone (transform
collapse and plumehead margin collapse). In contrast, two
proposed types of subduction initiation are not well supported by
natural observations: (induced) transference and (spontaneous)
passive margin collapse. Further work is therefore needed to
expand on and understand the implications of these observations.
Our future advancing understanding of SI will come from better
geologic insights, laboratory experiments, and numerical
modeling, and with improving communications between these

calibration of longitude against the prime meridian at Greenwich,
in combination with latitude derived from the positions of
celestial bodies gave mariners for the first time confidence that
they could calculate their position on the Earth's surface. Until
recently, Earth scientists have been in a comparable position of
having no way of calculating the longitudes of continents before
the Cretaceous. Here I discuss Phanerozoic polar wander and
paleogeographies and describe ways of quantitatively establishing
ancient longitudes which also establish how the Earth's interior
can be linked to its surface in geological time. The first method
makes use of the fact that longitudinal uncertainty of continents
that were assembled in Pangea can, for subsequent times, be
eliminated, if longitude motion is known for only one of these
continents. The best assumption is zero-longitude motion for
Africa and with this assumption we can show that large igneous
provinces (LIPs) and kimberlites almost exclusively erupted above
the margins of TUZO and JASON in the lower mantle. This
remarkable observation, also considering the effect of true polar
wander, has led to a second method the plume generation zone

absolute plate motions before Pangea and exploring links between
plate tectonics, intra-plate volcanism and Deep Earth dynamics.
Conceptually, that link can be viewed as a simple mass-balance:

wave-speed anomalies as subducted lithosphere and associate these
slabs with their geological record. We document this as the Atlas
of the Underworld, also accessible online at
www.atlas-of-the-underworld.org, a compilation comprising
subduction systems active in the past ~300Myr. Deeper slabs are
correlated to older geological records, assuming no relative
horizontal motions between adjacent slabs following break-off,
using knowledge of global plate circuits, but without assuming a
mantle reference frame. The longest actively subducting slabs
identified reach the depth of ~2500km and some slabs have
impinged on Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces in the deepest
mantle. Anomously fast sinking of some slabs occurs in regions
affected by long-term plume rising. We conclude that slab
remnants eventually sink from the upper mantle to the core-mantle
boundary. The range in subduction-age versus -- depth in the
lower mantle is largely inherited from the upper mantle history
of subduction. We find a significant depth variation in average
sinking speed of slabs. At the top of the lower mantle average
slab sinking speeds are between 10 and 40mm/yr, followed by a
deceleration to 10--15mm/yr down to depths around 1600--1700km.
In this interval, in situ time-stationary sinking rates suggest
deceleration from 20 to 30mm/yr to 4--8mm/yr, increasing to
12--15mm/yr below 2000km. This corroborates the existence of a
slab deceleration zone but we do not observe long-term (>60My)
slab stagnation, excluding long-term stagnation due to
compositional effects. Conversion of slab sinking profiles to
viscosity profiles shows the general trend that mantle viscosity
increases in the slab deceleration zone below which viscosity
slowly decreases in the deep mantle. This is at variance with
most published viscosity profiles that are derived from different

profiles suggested from material experiments.",

abstract="As the Earth's primary mode of planetary cooling, the oceanic
plate is created at mid-ocean ridges, transported across the
planet's surface, and destroyed at subduction zones. The
evolution of its buoyancy and rheology during its lifespan
maintains the coherence of the plate as a distinct geological
entity and controls the localised deformation and vertical
material exchange at plate boundaries, which enables the
horizontal ocean-plate movements. These motions intimately link
the oceanic plate to the overarching overturn of Earth's mantle:
The plate forms out of rising mantle material at spreading
ridges; it cools the Earth's interior as the cold thermal
boundary layer to mantle convection; and its sinking portions
drive not only the plate itself but also dominate global flow in
the mantle. We scrutinise here the entire life cycle of the
oceanic plate, starting with its birth at the mid-ocean ridge,
including the thermal, rheological, and chemical conditions of
initiation, followed by plate maturation as it ages and cools
while crossing the seafloor, and finishing with the dynamics of
plate destruction as it retires at the subduction zone to become
a deeper part of Earth's convective system. We find that the full
range of dynamic behaviour of the oceanic plate, including its
forcing and overall framework within Earth's convecting system,
is not fully captured by the existing concept of Plate Tectonics,
which describes solely the horizontal surface kinematics of all
plates. Therefore, we introduce a more specific and at the same
time more integral concept named ``Ocean-Plate Tectonics'' that
more specifically describes the dynamic life of the oceanic plate
and accounts for the knowledge gained during the past 50 years.
This ``Ocean-Plate Tectonics'' must have emerged on Earth at
least 1 Billion years ago, and dominates Earth's dynamics today.",

abstract="The terrestrial planets accreted from a diverse suite of solar
system materials ranging from strongly O-deficient materials
similar to enstatite chondrites via ordinary chondrite materials
to fully oxidised carbonaceous chondrite and cometary materials.
Heliocentric zoning with increasingly oxidised planetesimals
outwards through the protoplanetary disc is broadly reflected in
core fraction and FeOmantle concentration, ranging from 68 wt\%
core and 0.5 wt\% FeOmantle for Mercury to 18 wt\% core and 24
wt\% FeOmantle for Vesta. Mercury, Venus and Earth grew mostly
from materials which were isotopically similar to enstatite
chondrites, although Earth and Venus also received more oxidised
material. The elevated (Mg + Fe)/Si ratio, compared to
chondrites, in the bulk silicate fraction of the terrestrial
planets, except for Mercury, may be related to a combination of
nebular fractionation associated with forsterite condensation,
concentration of olivine-rich chondrules near the mid-plane of
the accretion disc and multi-cycle impact erosion of protocrusts.
For the extremely reduced Mercury the silicate magma ocean (MO,
list of abbreviations in Table 1) and a core with 15 wt\% Si
might have equilibrated with a melt layer of FeS at the
core-mantle boundary (CMB). Recent data from the MESSENGER
mission combined with experimentally derived phase relations,
support estimates of about 0.5 wt\% FeO and 10 wt\% S in the MO
and the current mantle. Core segregation at very high
temperatures for the largest planets Venus and Earth, led to
cores with high Si content, even at relatively high oxygen
fugacities and FeOmantle contents, because increasing temperature
shifts the equilibrium:SiO2MO+2Fecore=2FeOMO+Sicore towards the
products (right side). The hot protocores of Venus and Earth
might have started with about 5--7 wt\% Si and 2--3 wt\% O. Mars
and Vesta segregated S-rich cores at high oxygen fugacity and low
pressure. Strong partitioning of Fe and Mg to melt and solids,
respectively, caused neutrally buoyant bridgmanite (bm) to
crystallise from the MO at 1700--1860 km depth (72--80 GPa),
resulting in a separate basal magma ocean (BMO) within Earth, and
probably also in Venus. Slow cooling of a thermally insulated BMO
and core, accompanied by protracted crystallisation of bm and
ferropericlase (fp), would facilitate core-BMO chemical exchange
by reversing the equilibrium SiO2MO + 2Fecore = 2FeOMO + Sicore
towards the reactants. Transfer of silica crystals and a liquid
SiO2 component from the core to the BMO, and liquid FeO and Fe2O3
components from the BMO to the core, would increase the Si/Mg,
Mg/Fe and bm/fp ratio of the resulting cumulates. Because the
solidus temperature of peridotite is <200--300 K above the
present temperature of the outermost core, and the melting
interval of late-stage BMO melt enriched in Al, Fe, Ca and Na
would be lower than that of peridotite, the BMO might have
persisted through the Hadean and possibly also the Archean. Low
solid state diffusion rates, especially in bm, would have
restricted the core-mantle interaction upon BMO solidification,
but limited core-mantle interaction could possibly occur via
partially molten ultra-low velocity zones. An outermost stagnant
low-density and low-velocity core layer (E′-layer), with reduced
Si and elevated O contents relative to the convecting core,
appears to trace the core-BMO exchange. The E′-layer is
compositionally gradational towards the convecting core at 445 km
below the CMB. High thermal conductivity and minimal convective
entrainment in the low-viscosity core fluid might have developed
and stabilised such a gradational layer since the Hadean or early
Archean. The primordial bm-dominated cumulates with high Mg/Fe
ratios and viscosities may have become convectively aggregated
into large refractory domains, remaining neutrally buoyant in the
middle to upper parts of the lower mantle and resistant to
convective destruction. Late-stage dense BMO cumulates with
elevated Fe/Mg ratios relative to the bulk mantle composition
might represent a suitable material for 100--200 km thick
thermochemical piles at the bottom of the large low S-wave
velocity provinces (LLSVPs) under Africa and the Pacific. A
degree-2 convection pattern, possibly initiated and stabilised
during Earth's early rapid rotation, involving antipodally
ascending columns in equatorial positions and an intermediary
descending longitudinal belt, might have swept the late-stage,
dense bridgmanitic cumulates with high Fe/Mg-ratios, viscosity
and bulk modulus towards the root zones of the upwelling columns.",

presence of chemically buoyant and/or highly viscous subcratonic
roots. Simple physical scaling relationships are developed to
explore the buoyancy and/or viscosity conditions required to
stabilize such roots against large-scale deformation and rapid
remixing into the mantle. The scalings are tested using idealized
numerical simulations with good general agreement. Applied to
Earth, the scalings suggest that (1) buoyancy alone is unlikely
to stabilize cratonic roots and (2) if root viscosity is to
provide stability into the Archean, then roots must be 103 times
as viscous as the mantle. Based on available experimental data,
root dehydration cannot account for the required viscosity
increase. Temperature-dependent viscosity can stabilize roots,
but it does so at the expense of stagnating the entire mantle
lithosphere, i.e., at the expense of sacrificing plate tectonics.
This suggests that the plastic yielding properties of rocks at

convection with large radial and lateral viscosity contrasts. We
first identify the range of Rayleigh number, internal heat
production rate and yield stress for which models generate
plate-like behavior, surface heat flow, surface velocities, and
topography distribution comparable to Earth's. These models
produce both whole-mantle convection and small-scale convection
in the upper mantle, which results in small-scale (104 km)
dynamic topography, with a spectral power for intermediate scales
(500 to 104 km) comparable to estimates of present-day residual
topography. Timescales of convection and the associated dynamic
topography vary from five to several hundreds of millions of
years. For a Rayleigh number of 107, we investigate how
lithosphere yield stress variations (10?50 MPa) and the presence
of deep thermochemical heterogeneities favor small-scale (200?500
km) and intermediate-scale (500?104 km) dynamic topography by
controlling the formation of small-scale convection and the
number and distribution of subduction zones, respectively. The
interplay between mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics
generates a complex spatial and temporal pattern of dynamic
topography consistent with constraints for Earth.",

abstract="Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic
lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of
subduction and the operation of plate tectonics, which
characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because
the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic
crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic
lithosphere more buoyant than at present, and whether subduction
and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both
in the geological record and in geodynamic models. Here we show
that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant, early
continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational
stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to
initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of
subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to
progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within
continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining
the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of
Archaean cratons. Moreover, our model predicts a petrological
stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental
lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with
xenolith and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with
the existence of a mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity. The
slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have
kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the
Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier,
plate tectonics became self-sustaining.",

weathering reactions draw greenhouse gasses out of the

partly by surface temperature, which allows for the potential
that climate-tectonic coupling can buffer the surface conditions
of a planet in a manner that allows liquid water to exist over
extended timescales (a condition that allows a planet to be
habitable by life as we know it). We discuss modeling efforts to
explore the level to which climate-tectonic coupling can or
cannot regulate the surface temperature of a planet over geologic
time. Thematically, we focus on how coupled climate-tectonic
systems respond to the following: (1) changes in the mean pace of
tectonics and associated variations in mantle melting and
volcanism, (2) large-amplitude fluctuations about mean properties
such as mantle temperature and surface plate velocities, and (3)
changes in tectonic mode. We consider models that map the
conditions under which plate tectonics can or cannot provide
climate buffering as well as models that explore the potential
that alternate tectonic modes can provide a level of climate
buffering that allows liquid water to be present at a planet's

the statistical properties of plate distributions, were unable to

produced by a dynamic feedback between mantle convection and the
strength of the lithosphere. Using three-dimensional spherical
models of mantle convection that self-consistently produce the
plate size--frequency distribution observed for Earth, we show
that subduction geometry drives the tectonic fragmentation that
generates plates. The spacing between the slabs controls the
layout of large plates, and the stresses caused by the bending of
trenches break plates into smaller fragments. Our results explain
why the fast evolution in small back-arc plates reflects the

uncertainties in plate tectonic reconstructions are taken into

step further and apply the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to this

particularly adapted to solve high-dimensional data assimilation
problems with nonlinear dynamics. We tested the EnKF using
synthetic observations consisting of surface velocity and heat

it with the method developed previously. The EnKF performs on
average better and is more stable than the former method. Less
than 300 ensemble members are sufficient to reconstruct an

understanding of the stratigraphy, magmatism, deformation,
metamorphism and timing of mineralisation, in the eastern Yilgarn
Craton (EYC) of Western Australia. The integration of these
disciplines has enabled a holistic review of the tectonic history
of the EYC which favours a paraautochthonous tectonic model. A
significant advance has been the recognition of a ∼2810Ma rifting
event off the eastern margin of the Youanmi Terrane which set up
the north-northwest trending architecture of the EYC. Rifting was
followed by a ∼100 Myr long phase of tectonic activity initiated
by the establishment of a convergent margin at 2715Ma
characterised by a west-dipping subduction zone to the east of
the EYC. Subduction was associated with the deposition of
2715--2670Ma volcanic stratigraphy and the emplacement of
voluminous tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite magmatism, which
resulted in magmatic thickening of the crust. Volcanism was
terminated by a ∼5 Myr pulse of east-northeast contraction
followed by mid-orogenic extension possibly linked to
lithospheric and lower crustal delamination. The lack of
ultra-high pressure metamorphism and the presence of high
geothermal gradients preclude this contractional event from
recording continent--continent collision. Mid-orogenic extension
at 2665Ma resulted in the introduction of metasomatised mantle
melts (mafic-granites and syenites), deposition of siliciclastic
basins (which record metamorphic anticlockwise PTt paths) and the
start of significant economic gold mineralisation in the EYC.
High stretching factors and/or delamination associated with this
extension event resulted in significant heat input into the base
of the crust, which eventually led to the emplacement of Low-Ca
(crustal melt) granites and cratonisation of the EYC. Major gold
mineralisation postdates mid-orogenic extension, and was
associated with renewed compression-transpression (∼2650Ma) and
the development of steep predominantly north-northwest striking

Palaeoproterozoic basins in the eastern Capricorn Orogen, a major
tectonic unit between the Archaean Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons of

Bryah Group and consists of ultramafic and mafic schist and
metabasaltic hyaloclastites, sheeted dykes and a layered
mafic-ultramafic complex, collectively referred to as
metabasites, because they are generally metamorphosed to
greenschist facies. Chemically these rocks correspond to
komatiites, high-Mg basalts and tholeiites. Previous
interpretations have purported that these rocks represent
rift-related volcanics, ophiolites and mid-ocean ridge settings.
In this contribution, I show that the Narracoota Formation
metabasites were likely part of an ancient oceanic plateau,
created by a 2.0 Ga mantle plume. Geochemical data (eg REE
patterns) indicate that the metabasites are identical to modern
oceanic plateaux. The presence of orogenic gold lodes further
supports the oceanic plateau model. During the 1.96 Ga Glenburgh

of future allochthonous terranes (FATs), such as island arcs,

Using geodynamic numerical experiments, we demonstrate how
crustal properties of FATs impact the amount of FAT crust that is
accreted or subducted, the type of accretionary process, and the
style of deformation on the overriding plate. Our results show
that (1) accretion of crustal units occurs when there is a weak
detachment layer within the FAT, (2) the depth of detachment
controls the amount of crust accreted onto the overriding plate,
and (3) lithospheric buoyancy does not prevent FAT subduction
during constant convergence. Island arcs, oceanic plateaus, and
continental fragments will completely subduct, despite having
buoyant lithospheric densities, if they have rheologically strong
crusts. Weak basal layers, representing pre?existing weaknesses
or detachment layers, will either lead to underplating of faulted
blocks of FAT crust to the overriding plate or collision and
suturing of an unbroken FAT crust. Our experiments show that the
weak, ultramafic layer found at the base of island arcs and
oceanic plateaus plays a significant role in terrane accretion.
The different types of accretionary processes also affect
deformation and uplift patterns in the overriding plate, trench
migration and jumping, and the dip of the plate interface. The

the Earth's earliest-formed continental crust, and are thought to
have formed via partial melting of hydrated metabasalt. The
geodynamic environments in which such high-grade metamorphism and
anatexis may have occurred in the early Earth is strongly
debated. Constraining the pressure (P) and temperature (T)
conditions at which melts of appropriate composition can be
derived from protoliths containing plausible mineral assemblages
is central to addressing this question. Phase equilibrium
modelling has been undertaken for an enriched Archaean tholeiite
bulk composition---a suggested protolith for early-Earth TTG
magmas---using newly parameterised thermodynamic models that were
specifically developed to evaluate the anatectic behaviour of
metabasalt. Assuming minimal H2O saturation at the wet solidus,
the potential fertility of the studied metabasalt is greatest if
the solidus is crossed at a pressure of ∼11kbar, where the
solidus temperature reaches a minimum of ∼610°C. Major-element
compositions and proportions of calculated partial melts show the
best correlation with those of natural Archaean TTGs when in the
P--T range ∼800--950°C and ∼10--18kbar, which we suggest are
optimal conditions for their petrogenesis. Normative geochemistry
suggests that these melts would crystallise to broadly
trondhjemitic or tonalitic lithologies. Calculated modal
proportions of garnet, plagioclase, amphibole, and rutile in the
residuum, which control diagnostic trace-element signatures in
the melt, also show the best agreement with natural and
experimental data at these conditions. Importantly, although
partial melts calculated outside of this P--T range still produce
TTG-like major-element compositions and normative mineralogies,
they would poorly match the diagnostic trace-element signatures
of natural Archaean examples owing to the absences of key
minerals in the residuum. This optimal P--T range of 800--950°C
and 10--18kbar defined herein is most likely to characterise
metamorphism of hydrated basalt at the base of a 40-km-thick
Archaean oceanic plateau/overthickened crust, or else tectonic

within Mg-poorer magma with a dominant calc-alkaline affinity
during Pangea disassembly. These trends reflect temporal changes
in global mantle climate and global plate tectonics in response
to continental masses assembly and dispersal. We also show that
the final amalgamation of Pangea at ~300 Myr led to a long

proposed that a transition from passive to active rifting can
result from changes in buoyancy forces due to localized thinning

rifting near an Euler pole allow the quantification of these
buoyancy forces and show that gravitational stresses are strong
enough not only to sustain rifting and drive axis-parallel

crust and flow of deep crust is investigated using
two-dimensional numerical experiments of lithospheric extension

density parameter space is explored. Results indicate that the
style of extension of the shallow crust and the path, magnitude,
and rate of flow of deep crust are dynamically linked through the
deep-crust viscosity, with density playing an important role in
experiments with a high-viscosity deep crust. Three main groups
of domes are defined based on their mechanisms of exhumation
across the viscosity-density parameter space. In the first group
(low-viscosity, low-density deep crust), domes develop by lateral
and upward flow of the deep crust at kmm.y−1 velocity rates (i.e.
rate of experiment boundary extension). In this case, extension
in the shallow crust is localized on a single interface, and the
deep crust traverses the entire thickness of the crust to the
Earth's near-surface in 5m.y. This high exhuming power relies on
the dynamic feedback between the flow of deep crust and the
localization of extension in the shallow crust. The second group
(intermediate-viscosity, low-density deep crust) has less
exhuming power because the stronger deep crust flows less readily
and instead accommodates more uniform extension, which imparts
distributed extension to the shallow crust. The third group
represents the upper limits of viscosity and density for the deep

localized thinning of the crust with large upward motion of the

major transition---to stagnant lid convection. This is an
asymptotic regime in which a stagnant lid is formed on the top of
the layer and convection is driven by the intrinsic, rheological,
temperature scale, rather than by the entire temperature drop in
the layer. A finite element multigrid scheme appropriate for
large viscosity variations is employed and convection with up to
1014 viscosity contrasts has been systematically investigated in
a 2D square cell with free-slip boundaries. We reached the
asymptotic regime in the limit of large viscosity contrasts and
obtained scaling relations which are found to be in good

abstract="Concentrated strain within plate margins and a significant
toroidal component in global plate motion are among the most
fundamental features of plate tectonics. A significant
proportion of strain in plate margins is accommodated through
motion on major tectonic faults. The decoupling influence of
faulted plate margins primarily results from history?dependent
lithospheric deformation rather than from instantaneous
stress?weakening rheologies. For instantaneous mantle flow
models, we argue that faults should be treated as preexisting
mechanical structures. With models incorporating preexisting
faults, a power law rheology with an exponent of 3, and slab
pull and ridge push forces, we demonstrate that nonlinear
interaction between weak faults and this power law rheology
produces plate?like motion. Our models show that in order to
produce plate?like motion, the frictional stress on faults needs
to be small and the asthenosphere viscosity should be much
weaker than that of lithosphere. While both plateness and the
ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities are reduced with
increasing fault coupling, the viscosity contrast between the
lithosphere and asthenosphere only influences plateness. This
shows that both diagnostics, plateness and the ratio of toroidal
to poloidal velocities, are necessary to characterize plate
motion. The models demonstrate that weak transform faults can
guide plate motion. This guiding property of transform faults
and the decoupling of thrust faults result in oblique subduction
where the strike of subducted slabs is oblique to transform
faults. Subducted slabs beneath a dipping fault produce oceanic

author="Beall, A P and Moresi, L and Cooper, C M",
abstract="Earth's oldest near-surface material, the cratonic crust, is
typically underlain by thick lithosphere (>200 km) of Archean
age. This cratonic lithosphere likely thickened in a
high-compressional-stress environment, potentially linked to the
onset of crustal shortening in the Neoarchean. Mantle convection
in the hotter Archean Earth would have imparted relatively low
stresses on the lithosphere, whether or not plate tectonics was
operating, so a high stress signal from the early Earth is
paradoxical. We propose that a rapid transition from heat
pipe--mode convection to the onset of plate tectonics generated
the high stresses required to thicken the cratonic lithosphere.
Numerical calculations are used to demonstrate that an existing
buoyant and strong layer, representing depleted continental
lithosphere, can thicken and stabilize during a lid-breaking
event. The peak compressional stress experienced by the
lithosphere is 3$\times$--4$\times$ higher than for the
stagnant-lid or mobile-lid regimes immediately before and after.
It is plausible that the cratonic lithosphere has not been
subjected to this high stress state since, explaining its
long-term stability. The lid-breaking thickening event reproduces
features observed in typical Neoarchean cratons, such as
lithospheric seismological reflectors and the formation of thrust
faults. Paleoarchean ``pre-tectonic'' structures can also survive
the lid-breaking event, acting as strong rafts that are assembled
during the compressive event. Together, the results indicate that
the signature of a catastrophic switch from a stagnant-lid Earth
to the initiation of plate tectonics has been captured and
preserved in the characteristics of cratonic crust and
lithosphere.",

abstract="We have studied the consequences of including
temperature-dependent viscosity in mantle convection with both of
the major phase transitions included. We have employed a
two-dimensional cartesian model in a box of aspect ratio four.
The time-dependent equations have been cast within an extended
Boussinesq framework in which each of the phase changes has been
simulated by an enhanced thermal expansivity. Both latent heat
release and viscous dissipation have been considered. Two
different forms of temperature-dependent viscosity, the Arrhenius
and the Frank-Kamenetzky forms, have been employed. We have
considered both models with a constant temperature (equilibrium)
boundary condition at the core-mantle boundary and models with a
time-varying (non-equilibrium) temperature boundary condition
from cooling of the core. The effects of temperature-dependent
viscosity are to enhance the tendency of the convective system to
be layered because of the influences of the latent heat release
and the mechanical heating on creating a sharp viscosity drop
across the transition zone. We have found that there is a
non-linear coupling between latent heat release from the
interaction of the hot plume with the endothermic phase
transition and the temperature-dependent viscosity. This positive
feedback process can give rise to the production of very high
temperatures in the transition zone, which may cause melting in
the region between the two major phase transitions. Flushing
events produced by the non-equilibrium boundary condition are
much more dramatic than those generated by the equilibrium
boundary condition. The non-linear coupling between latent heat
release and temperature-dependent viscosity is also stronger in
the non-equilibrium models. Comparison with models without the
presence of latent heat release and viscous dissipation shows
that the models without the heating terms produce a greater
degree of mass flux across the endothermic phase boundary because
of the lack of the viscosity stratification in the interior of
the convective flow. Results of this moded can be applied to
other types of endothermic phase transition found in the

constraints that must be met by possible model surface histories:
(1) near random spatial distribution of ∼975 craters, and (2) few
obviously modified impact craters. Catastrophic resurfacing
obviously meets these constraints, but equilibrium resurfacing
histories require a balance between crater distribution and
modification to be viable. Equilibrium resurfacing scenarios with
small incremental resurfacing areas meet constraint 1 but not 2,

constraint 2 but not 1. Results of Monte Carlo modeling of
equilibrium resurfacing (Strom et al., 1994) is widely cited as
support for catastrophic resurfacing hypotheses and as evidence
against hypotheses of equilibrium resurfacing. However, the Monte
Carlo models did not consider intermediate-size incremental
resurfacing areas, nor did they consider histories in which the
era of impact crater formation outlasts an era of equilibrium
resurfacing. We construct three suites of Monte Carlo experiments
that examine incremental resurfacing areas not previously
considered (5\%, 1\%, 0.7\%, and 0.1\%), and that vary the
duration of resurfacing relative to impact crater formation time
(1:1 [suite A], 5:6 [suite B], and 2:3 [suite C]). We test the
model results against the two impact crater constraints. Several
experiments met both constraints. The shorter the time period of
equilibrium resurfacing, or the longer the time of crater
formation following the cessation of equilibrium resurfacing, the
larger the possible areas of incremental resurfacing that satisfy

from a high melt-fraction asthenosphere through the lithosphere

high surface heat flow, the rapid volcanic resurfacing produces a
thick, cold, and strong lithosphere which undergoes contractional
strain forced by downward advection of the surface toward smaller
radii. We hypothesize that heat-pipe cooling is the last
significant endogenic resurfacing process experienced by most

abstract="Small-scale convection associated with instabilities at the
bottom of the lithospheric plates on the Earth and other
terrestrial planets occurs in the stagnant lid regime of
temperature-dependent viscosity convection. Systematic numerical
simulations of time-dependent, internally heated stagnant lid
convection suggest simple scaling relationships for a variety of
convective parameters and in a broad range of power law
viscosities. Application of these scaling relationships to the
Earth's oceanic lithosphere shows that for either diffusion or
dislocation viscosity of olivine, convective instabilities occur
in the lower part of the lithosphere between 85 and 100 km depth
(the rheological sublayer). ``Wet'' olivine satisfies constraints
on the heat flux and mantle temperature better than ``dry''
olivine, supporting the view that the upper mantle of the Earth
is wet. This is also consistent with the fact that the
rheological sublayer is located below the Gutenberg discontinuity
which was proposed to represent a sharp change in water content.
The viscosity of asthenosphere is (3--6)$\times$1018 Pa s,
consistent with previous estimates. The velocities of cold plumes
are relatively high reaching several meters per year in the
dislocation creep regime. A low value of the heat flux in old
continental cratons suggests that continental lithosphere might
be convectively stable unless it is perturbed by processes
associated with plate tectonics and hot plumes. The absence of
plate tectonics on other terrestrial planets and the low heat
transport efficiency of stagnant lid convection can lead to
widespread melting during the thermal evolution of the

abstract="The Frank-Kamenetskii (FK) approximation is a common method to
represent the Arrhenius-type viscosity of planetary mantles
because it reduces the viscosity contrast in the lithosphere to
save computational resources and prevent numerical errors. In
some cases, this approximation does not lead to satisfying
results; for example, it can lead to a mobile-lid regime,
whereas use of the Arrhenius law shows a thin stagnant lid. We
therefore derive a new, more accurate approximation called
`damped FK approximation' for a temperature- and
pressure-dependent viscosity. This damped FK approximation is a
mixture between the standard first-order FK approximation and an
approximation of second-order accuracy controlled by a damping
parameter. Furthermore, the FK parameters are determined
self-consistently at every time step. This study shows that the
damped FK approximation represents the mantle flow of an
Arrhenius-type viscosity for a much larger parameter space than
for the standard first-order approximation. It can also be used
to simulate terrestrial planets, such as super-Earths, with high
pressure dependence of the viscosity, if the surface temperature
does not exceed a specific threshold value and if a high enough
damping parameter is used. We also test the FK approximation for
plate tectonics simulations. The second-order FK approximation
best represents the Arrhenius flow in the investigated parameter
range. In particular, the dependence of the critical yield
stress, at which the transition from the plate tectonics regime
to the stagnant-lid regime can be observed, on the Rayleigh
number can differ from the Arrhenius case (and the second-order
FK approximation) when using a first-order FK approximation or

evidence for the declining rates of continental crustal growth

present continental crustal reservoir was extracted by the end of
the Archaean eon. Patterns of crustal growth and reworking in
rocks younger than three billion years (Gyr) are thought to
reflect the assembly and break-up of supercontinents by Wilson
cycle processes and mark an important change in lithosphere
dynamics. In southern West Greenland numerous studies have,
however, argued for subduction settings and crust growth by arc
accretion back to 3.8 Gyr ago, suggesting that modern-day
tectonic regimes operated during the formation of the earliest
crustal rock record. Here we report in situ uranium-lead, hafnium

southern West Greenland across the critical time period during
which modern-like tectonic regimes could have initiated. Our data
show pronounced differences in the hafnium isotope-time patterns

the magmatic protolith. The observations suggest that
3.9-3.5-Gyr-old rocks differentiated from a >3.9-Gyr-old source

the first additions of juvenile depleted material (that is, new

striking shifts in hafnium isotope ratios similar to those shown

abstract="We integrate an updated worldwide compilation of U/Pb, Hf-isotope
and trace-element data on zircon, and Re--Os model ages on
sulfides and alloys in mantle-derived rocks and xenocrysts, to
examine patterns of crustal evolution and crust--mantle
interaction from 4.5Ga to 2.4Ga ago. The data suggest that during
the period from 4.5Ga to ca 3.4Ga, Earth's crust was essentially
stagnant and dominantly mafic in composition. Zircon crystallized
mainly from intermediate melts, probably generated both by
magmatic differentiation and by impact melting. This quiescent
state was broken by pulses of juvenile magmatic activity at ca
4.2Ga, 3.8Ga and 3.3--3.4Ga, which may represent mantle overturns
or plume episodes. Between these pulses, there is evidence of
reworking and resetting of U--Pb ages (by impact?) but no further
generation of new juvenile crust. There is no evidence of
plate-tectonic activity, as described for the Phanerozoic Earth,
before ca 3.4Ga, and previous modelling studies indicate that the
early Earth may have been characterised by an episodic-overturn,
or even stagnant-lid, regime. New thermodynamic modelling
confirms that an initially hot Earth could have a stagnant lid
for ca 300Ma, and then would experience a series of massive
overturns at intervals on the order of 150Ma until the end of the
EoArchean. The subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) sampled
on Earth today did not exist before ca 3.5Ga. A lull in crustal
production around 3.0Ga coincides with the rapid buildup of a
highly depleted, buoyant SCLM, which peaked around 2.7--2.8Ga;
this pattern is consistent with one or more major mantle
overturns. The generation of continental crust peaked later in
two main pulses at ca 2.75Ga and 2.5Ga; the latter episode was
larger and had a greater juvenile component. The age/Hf-isotope
patterns of the crust generated from 3.0 to 2.4Ga are similar to
those in the internal orogens of the Gondwana supercontinent, and
imply the existence of plate tectonics related to the assembly of
the Kenorland (ca 2.5Ga) supercontinent. There is a clear link in
these data between the generation of the SCLM and the emergence
of modern plate tectonics; we consider this link to be causal, as
well as temporal. The production of both crust and SCLM declined
toward a marked low point by ca 2.4Ga. The data naturally divide
the Archean into three periods: PaleoArchean (4.0--3.6Ga),
MesoArchean (3.6--3.0Ga) and NeoArchean (3.0--2.4Ga); we suggest
that this scheme could usefully replace the current four-fold
division of the Archean.",

abstract="The feedback between plate tectonics and mantle convection
controls the Earth's thermal evolution via the seafloor age
distribution. We therefore designed the MACMA model to simulate
time-dependent plate tectonics in a 2D cylindrical geometry with
evolutive plate boundaries, based on multiagent systems that
express thermal and mechanical interactions. We compute plate
velocities using a local force balance and use explicit
parameterizations to treat tectonic processes such as trench
migration, subduction initiation, continental breakup and plate
suturing. These implementations allow the model to update its
geometry and thermal state at all times. Our approach has two
goals: (1) to test how empirically- and analytically-determined
rules for surface processes affect mantle and plate dynamics, and
(2) to investigate how plate tectonics impact the thermal regime.
Our predictions for driving forces, plate velocities and heat
flux are in agreement with independent observations. Two time
scales arise for the evolution of the heat flux: a linear
long-term decrease and high-amplitude short-term fluctuations due
to surface tectonics. We also obtain a plausible thermal history,
with mantle temperature decreasing by less than 200 K over the
last 3 Gyr. In addition, we show that on the long term, mantle
viscosity is less thermally influential than tectonic processes
such as continental breakup or subduction initiation, because
Earth's cooling rate depends mainly on its ability to replace old
insulating seafloor by young thin oceanic lithosphere. We infer
that simple convective considerations alone cannot account for

Yff, Jessica A and Jaeger, Windy L and Schenk, Paul M and
Geissler, Paul E and Becker, Tammy L",
abstract="We produced the first complete, 1:15M-scale global geologic map
of Jupiter's moon Io, based on a set of monochrome and color
Galileo--Voyager image mosaics produced at a spatial resolution
of 1km/pixel. The surface of Io was mapped into 19 units based on
albedo, color and surface morphology, and is subdivided as
follows: plains (65.8\% of surface), lava flow fields (28.5\%),
mountains (3.2\%), and patera floors (2.5\%). Diffuse deposits
(DD) that mantle the other units cover ∼18\% of Io's surface, and
are distributed as follows: red (8.6\% of surface), white
(6.9\%), yellow (2.1\%), black (0.6\%), and green (∼0.01\%).
Analyses of the geographical and areal distribution of these
units yield a number of results, summarized below. (1) The
distribution of plains units of different colors is generally
geographically constrained: Red--brown plains occur >$\pm$30°
latitude, and are thought to result from enhanced alteration of
other units induced by radiation coming in from the poles. White
plains (possibly dominated by SO2+contaminants) occur mostly in
the equatorial antijovian region ($\pm$30°, 90--230°W), possibly
indicative of a regional cold trap. Outliers of white, yellow,
and red--brown plains in other regions may result from long-term
accumulation of white, yellow, and red diffuse deposits,
respectively. (2) Bright (possibly sulfur-rich) flow fields make
up 30\% more lava flow fields than dark (presumably silicate)
flows (56.5\% vs. 43.5\%), and only 18\% of bright flow fields
occur within 10km of dark flow fields. These results suggest that
secondary sulfurous volcanism (where a bright-dark association is
expected) could be responsible for only a fraction of Io's recent
bright flows, and that primary sulfur-rich effusions could be an
important component of Io's recent volcanism. An unusual
concentration of bright flows at ∼45--75°N, ∼60--120°W could be
indicative of more extensive primary sulfurous volcanism in the
recent past. However, it remains unclear whether most bright
flows are bright because they are sulfur flows, or because they
are cold silicate flows covered in sulfur-rich particles from
plume fallout. (3) We mapped 425 paterae (volcano-tectonic
depressions), up from 417 previously identified by Radebaugh et
al. (Radebaugh, J., Keszthelyi, L.P., McEwen, A.S., Turtle, E.P.,
Jaeger, W., Milazzo, M. [2001]. J. Geophys. Res. 106,
33005--33020). Although these features cover only 2.5\% of Io's
surface, they correspond to 64\% of all detected hot spots; 45\%
of all hot spots are associated with the freshest dark patera
floors, reflecting the importance of active silicate volcanism to
Io's heat flow. (4) Mountains cover only ∼3\% of the surface,
although the transition from mountains to plains is gradational
with the available imagery. 49\% of all mountains are lineated
and presumably layered, showing evidence of linear structures
supportive of a tectonic origin. In contrast, only 6\% of visible
mountains are mottled (showing hummocks indicative of mass
wasting) and 4\% are tholi (domes or shields), consistent with a
volcanic origin. (5) Initial analyses of the geographic
distributions of map units show no significant longitudinal
variation in the quantity of Io's mountains or paterae, in
contrast to earlier studies. This is because we use the area of
mountain and patera materials as opposed to the number of
structures, and our result suggests that the previously proposed
anti-correlation of mountains and paterae (Schenk, P., Hargitai,
H., Wilson, R., McEwen, A., Thomas, P. [2001]. J. Geophys. Res.
106, 33201--33222; Kirchoff, M.R., McKinnon, W.B., Schenk, P.M.
[2011]. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 301, 22--30) is more complex
than previously thought. There is also a slight decrease in
surface area of lava flows toward the poles of Io, perhaps
indicative of variations in volcanic activity. (6) The freshest
bright and dark flows make up about 29\% of all of Io's flow
fields, suggesting active emplacement is occurring in less than a
third of Io's visible lava fields. (7) About 47\% of Io's diffuse
deposits (by area) are red, presumably deriving their color from
condensed sulfur gas, and ∼38\% are white, presumably dominated
by condensed SO2. The much greater areal extent of gas-derived
diffuse deposits (red+white, 85\%) compared to presumably
pyroclast-bearing diffuse deposits (dark (silicate tephra)+yellow
(sulfur-rich tephra), 15\%) indicates that there is effective
separation between the transport of tephra and gas in many Ionian
explosive eruptions. Future improvements in the geologic mapping
of Io can be obtained via (a) investigating the relationships
between different color/material units that are geographically
and temporally associated, (b) better analysis of the temporal
variations in the map units, and (c) additional high-resolution
images (spatial resolutions ∼200m/pixel or better). These
improvements would be greatly facilitated by new data, which
could be obtained by future missions.",

the predicted zone of extensional strain northwest of Isidis
constrains the thickness of the elastic lithosphere to be
100--180 km thick beneath the basin at the time of loading. We
also find that loads outside of the basin play a significant role
in the interpretation of the tectonics; simplified models tend to
overestimate the lithospheric thickness. We place relatively

abstract="We present three 3D numerical models of deep subduction where
buoyant material from an oceanic plateau and a plume interact
with the overriding plate to assess the influence on subduction
dynamics, trench geometry, and mechanisms for plateau accretion
and continental growth. Transient instabilities of the convergent
margin are produced, resulting in: contorted trench geometry;
trench migration parallel with the plate margin; folding of the
subducting slab and orocline development at the convergent
margin; and transfer of the plateau to the overriding plate. The
presence of plume material beneath the oceanic plateau causes
flat subduction above the plume, resulting in a ``bowed'' shaped
subducting slab. In plateau-only models, plateau accretion at the
edge of the overriding plate results in trench migration around
the edge of the plateau before subduction is re-established
directly behind the trailing edge of the plateau. The plateau
shortens and some plateau material subducts. The presence of
buoyant plume material beneath the oceanic plateau has a profound
influence on the behaviour of the convergent margin. In the
plateau + plume model, plateau accretion causes rapid trench
advance. Plate convergence is accommodated by shearing at the
base of the plateau and shortening in the overriding plate. The
trench migrates around the edge of the plateau and subduction is
re-established well behind the trailing edge of the plateau,
effectively embedding the plateau into the overriding plate. A
slab window forms beneath the accreted plateau and plume material
is transferred from the subducting plate to the overriding plate
through the window. In all of the models, the subduction zone
maintains a relatively stable configuration away from the
buoyancy anomalies within the downgoing plate. The models provide
a dynamic context for plateau and plume accretion in Phanerozoic
accretionary orogenic systems such as the East China Orogen and
the Central Asian Orogen (Altiads), which are characterised by
accreted ophiolite complexes with diverse geochemical affinities,
and a protracted evolution of accretion of exotic terranes

abstract="The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water
oceans on rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks
involved in silicate weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial
role in driving the long-term carbon cycle because it is
responsible for CO 2 degassing at ridges and arcs, the return of
CO 2 to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh,
weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However,
the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate
according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool
surface temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous
plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that
the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon
cycle are uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics.
Furthermore, initial atmospheric CO 2 conditions do not impact
the final climate state reached when the carbon cycle comes to
equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present and silicate
weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO 2 rich
atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate
climate and plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally
supply limited weathering does prevent the development of
temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land areas
and large total CO 2 budgets because supply limited weathering
lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply
limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could
experience significant water loss. Supply limited weathering is
less likely on plate tectonic planets because plate tectonics
promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock

title="Is plate tectonics needed to evolve technological species on
exoplanets?",
author="Stern, Robert J",
abstract="As we continue searching for exoplanets, we wonder if life and
technological species capable of communicating with us exists on
any of them. As geoscientists, we can also wonder how important
is the presence or absence of plate tectonics for the evolution
of technological species. This essay considers this question,
focusing on tectonically active rocky (silicate) planets, like
Earth, Venus, and Mars. The development of technological species
on Earth provides key insights for understanding evolution on
exoplanets, including the likely role that plate tectonics may
play. An Earth-sized silicate planet is likely to experience
several tectonic styles over its lifetime, as it cools and its
lithosphere thickens, strengthens, and becomes denser. These
include magma ocean, various styles of stagnant lid, and perhaps
plate tectonics. Abundant liquid water favors both life and plate
tectonics. Ocean is required for early evolution of diverse
single-celled organisms, then colonies of cells which specialized
further to form guts, appendages, and sensory organisms up to the
complexity of fish (central nervous system, appendages, eyes).
Large expanses of dry land also begin in the ocean, today
produced above subduction zones in juvenile arcs and by their
coalescence to form continents, although it is not clear that
plate tectonics was required to create continental crust on
Earth. Dry land of continents is required for further evolution
of technological species, where modification of appendages for
grasping and manipulating, and improvement of eyes and central
nervous system could be perfected. These bioassets allowed
intelligent creatures to examine the night sky and wonder, the
beginning of abstract thinking, including religion and science.
Technology arises from the exigencies of daily living such as
tool-making, agriculture, clothing, and weapons, but the pace of
innovation accelerates once it is allied with science. Finally,
the importance of plate tectonics for developing a technological
species is examined via a thought experiment using two otherwise
identical planets: one with plate tectonics and the other
without. A planet with oceans, continents, and plate tectonics
maximizes opportunities for speciation and natural selection,
whereas a similar planet without plate tectonics provides fewer
such opportunities. Plate tectonics exerts environmental
pressures that drive evolution without being capable of
extinguishing all life. Plate tectonic processes such as the
redistribution of continents, growth of mountain ranges,
formation of land bridges, and opening and closing of oceans
provide a continuous but moderate environmental pressure that
stimulates populations to adapt and evolve. Plate tectonics may
not be needed in order for life to begin, but evolution of
technological species is favored on planets with oceans,
continents, plate tectonics, and intermittently clear night sky.",

crust growth --- A testable hypothesis",
author="Niu, Yaoling and Zhao, Zhidan and Zhu, Di-Cheng and Mo, Xuanxue",
abstract="Abstract The significance of the continental crust (CC) on which
we live is self-evident. However, our knowledge remains limited
on its origin, its way and rate of growth, and how it has
acquired the ``andesitic'' composition from mantle derived
magmas. Compared to rocks formed from mantle derived magmas in
all geological environments, volcanic arc rocks associated with
seafloor subduction share some common features with the CC; both
are relatively depleted in ``fluid-insoluble'' elements (e.g.,
Nb, Ta and Ti), but enriched in ``fluid-soluble'' elements (e.g.,
U, K and Pb). These chemical characteristics are referred to as
the ``arc-like signature'', and point to a possible link between
subduction-zone magmatism and CC formation, thus leading to the
``island arc'' model widely accepted for the origin of the CC
over the past 45 years. However, this ``island--arc'' model has
many difficulties: e.g., (1) the bulk arc crust (AC) is basaltic
whereas the bulk CC is andesitic; (2) the AC has variably large
Sr excess whereas the CC is weakly Sr deficient; and (3) AC
production is mass-balanced by subduction erosion and sediment
recycling, thus contributing no net mass to the CC growth, at
least in the Phanerozoic. Our recent and ongoing studies on
granitoid rocks (both volcanic and intrusive) formed in response
to the India--Asia continental collision (~ 55 $\pm$ 10 Ma) show
remarkable compositional similarity to the bulk CC with the
typical ``arc-like signature''. Also, these syncollisional
granitoid rocks exhibit strong mantle isotopic signatures,
meaning that they were recently derived from a mantle source. The
petrology and geochemistry of these syncollisional granitoid
rocks are most consistent with an origin via partial melting of
the upper ocean crust (i.e., last fragments of underthrusting
ocean crust upon collision) under amphibolite facies conditions,
adding net mantle-derived materials to form juvenile CC mass.
This leads to the logical and testable hypothesis that
continental collision produces and preserves the juvenile crust,
and hence maintains net CC growth. Importantly, the history of
the Greater Tibetan Plateau from the Early Paleozoic to present
manifests the history of ``super'' continent amalgamation through
a series of continental collision events with production and
preservation of abundant syncollisional granitoids. Plate
tectonics in terms of seafloor spreading and subduction is a
continuous process on a global scale since its inception (in the
early Archean?), whereas continental collision on regional scales
and super-continental formation on a global scale are episodic
(vs. continuous). Hence, continental collision with juvenile
crust formation/preservation and super-continent amalgamation
explains the episodic growth of the CC. We are continuing testing
and refining this hypothesis by detailed petrological,
geochemical and geochronological studies of syncollisional
granitoids along older collision zones in central-west China,
especially on the northern Tibetan Plateau in a global context.",

evolution and geological implications",
author="Walzer, U and Hendel, R",
abstract="Abstract Oceanic plateaus develop by decompression melting of
mantle plumes and have contributed to the growth of the
continental crust throughout Earth's evolution. Occasional
large-scale partial melting events of parts of the asthenosphere
during the Archean produced large domains of precursor crustal
material. The fractionation of arc-related crust during the
Proterozoic and Phanerozoic contributed to the growth of
continental crust. However, it remains unclear whether the
continents or their precursors formed during episodic events or
whether the gaps in zircon age records are a function of varying
preservation potential. This study demonstrates that the
formation of the continental crust was intrinsically tied to the
thermoconvective evolution of the Earth's mantle. Our numerical
solutions for the full set of physical balance equations of
convection in a spherical shell mantle, combined with simplified
equations of chemical continent--mantle differentiation,
demonstrate that the actual rate of continental growth is not
uniform through time. The kinetic energy of solid-state mantle
creep (Ekin) slowly decreases with superposed episodic but not
periodic maxima. In addition, laterally averaged surface heat
flow (qob) behaves similarly but shows peaks that lag by 15--30
Ma compared with the Ekin peaks. Peak values of continental
growth are delayed by 75--100 Ma relative to the qob maxima. The
calculated present-day qob and total continental mass values
agree well with observed values. Each episode of continental
growth is separated from the next by an interval of quiescence
that is not the result of variations in mantle creep velocity but
instead reflects the fact that the peridotite solidus is not only
a function of pressure but also of local water abundance. A
period of differentiation results in a reduction in regional
water concentrations, thereby increasing the temperature of the
peridotite solidus and the regional viscosity of the mantle. By
plausibly varying the parameters in our model, we were able to
reproduce the intervals of the observed frequency peaks of zircon
age determinations without essentially changing any of the other
results. The results yield a calculated integrated continental
growth curve that resembles the curves of GLAM, Begg et al.

CMB-lids but instead a hot lower mantle and core as well as
sluggish lower mantle convection. This implies that the initial
interior temperatures, especially in the lower mantle, become
crucial for the thermal evolution---the thermostat effect
suggested to regulate the interior temperatures in terrestrial
planets does not work for massive planets if the viscosity is
strongly pressure dependent. The sluggish convection and the
potential formation of the CMB-lid reduce the convective vigor

tectonics system allows multiple tectonic modes to exist for
equivalent planetary parameter values. The tectonic mode of the
system is then determined by its specific geologic and climatic
history. This implies that models of tectonics and mantle
convection will not be able to uniquely determine the tectonic
mode of a terrestrial planet without the addition of historical
data. Historical data exists, to variable degrees, for all four
terrestrial planets within our solar system. For the Earth, the
planet with the largest amount of observational data, debate
does still remain regarding the geologic and climatic history of
Earth's deep past but constraints are available. For planets in
other solar systems, no such constraints exist at present. The
existence of multiple tectonic modes, for equivalent parameter
values, points to a reason why different groups have reached
different conclusions regarding the tectonic state of extrasolar
terrestrial planets larger than Earth (``super-Earths''). The
region of multiple stable solutions is predicted to widen in
parameter space for more energetic mantle convection (as would
be expected for larger planets). This means that different

The spatial and temporal distribution of the Earth's record of
rock units and events is heterogeneous with distinctive peaks and
troughs in the distribution of ages of igneous crystallisation,
metamorphism, continental margins and mineralisation. This
distribution reflects the different preservation potential of
rocks generated in different tectonic settings, rather than
fundamental pulses of activity, and the peaks of ages are linked
to the timing of supercontinent assembly. In contrast there are
other signals, such as the Sr isotope ratios of seawater, mantle
temperatures, and redox conditions on the Earth, where the
records are regarded as primary because they are not sensitive to
the numbers of samples of different ages that have been analysed.
New models based on the U--Pb, Hf and O isotope ratios of
detrital zircons suggest that at least ~ 60--70\% of the present
volume of the continental crust had been generated by 3 Ga. The
growth of continental crust was a continuous rather than an
episodic process, but there was a marked decrease in the rate of
crustal growth at ~ 3 Ga. This appears to have been linked to
significant crustal recycling and the onset plate tectonics. The
60--70\% of the present volume of the continental crust estimated
to have been present at 3 Ga, contrasts markedly with the < 10\%

author="H{\"o}ning, Dennis and Spohn, Tilman",
abstract="Abstract A model of Earth's continental coverage and mantle water
budget is discussed along with its thermal evolution. The model
links a thermal evolution model based on parameterized mantle
convection with a model of a generic subduction zone that
includes the oceanic crust and a sedimentary layer as carriers of
water. Part of the subducted water is used to produce continental
crust while the remainder is subducted into the mantle. The total
length of the subduction zones is calculated from the total
surface area of continental crust assuming randomly distributed
continents. The mantle viscosity is dependent of temperature and
the water concentration. Sediments are generated by continental
crust erosion, and water outgassing at mid-oceanic ridges closes
the water cycle. We discuss the strongly coupled, non-linear
model using a phase plane defined by the continental coverage and
mantle water concentration. Fixed points are found in the phase
plane at which the rates of change of both variables are zero.
These fixed points evolve with time, but in many cases, three
fixed points emerge of which two are stable and an intermediate
point is unstable with respect to continental coverage. With
initial conditions from a Monte-Carlo scheme we calculate
evolution paths in the phase plane and find a large spread of
final states that all have a mostly balanced water budget. The
present day observed 40\% continental surface coverage is found
near the unstable fixed point. Our evolution model suggests that
Earth's continental coverage formed early and has been stable for
at least 1.5 Gyr. The effect of mantle water regassing (and
mantle viscosity depending on water concentration) is found to
lower the present day mantle temperature by about 120 K, but the
present day mantle viscosity is affected little. The water cycle
thus complements the well-known thermostat effect of viscosity
and mantle temperature. Our results further suggest that the
biosphere could impact the feedback cycles by its effects on

author="Zhong, Shijie and Liu, Xi",
abstract="Abstract The Earth's lower mantle structure, as revealed by
seismic tomography studies, is best characterized by two large
low seismic velocity provinces (i.e., LLSVP) beneath Africa and
Pacific and their surrounding, circum-Pacific seismically fast
anomalies. This mantle structure, sometimes called degree-2
structure, has been the most robust feature of all the seismic
tomography models for the last 30 years. The dominantly degree-2
mantle structure explains the long-wavelength geoid anomalies
including the geoid highs over Africa and Pacific. The LLSVPs are
suggested to be the source regions for hotspot volcanism and
large igneous province (LIP) events that are compositionally
distinct from that for mid-ocean ridge basalts, thus holding the
key to understanding mantle geochemistry. The degree-2 structure
and LLSVPs have also been used as a reference frame to
reconstruct paleogeography and true polar wander (TPW) history of
the Earth for the Phanerozoic (i.e., for the last 500 Ma). This
paper presents a comprehensive review of studies on the degree-2
mantle structure. While seismic tomography inversion and models
are discussed, the main focus of the paper is on the dynamics of
long-wavelength mantle convection, plate tectonics and
large-scale volcanism. Important topics in the paper include: 1)
the long-wavelength seismic structure for the present-day mantle,
its possible relation to the long-wavelength geoid anomalies,
volcanism and magmatism, and plate motion history, 2) the time
evolution of the long-wavelength mantle structure in the
Phanerozoic and its relations to Pangea assembly and breakup and
history of volcanism/LIP events, and 3) the physics that controls
the dynamics of long-wavelength mantle convection. The paper also
provides a critical assessment on the validity of the hypothesis
of spatially stationary Africa and Pacific LLSVPs since the early
Paleozoic and its implications.",

author="Stern, Robert J and Gerya, Taras and Tackley, Paul J",
abstract="Abstract To better understand Earth's present tectonic
style--plate tectonics--and how it may have evolved from single
plate (stagnant lid) tectonics, it is instructive to consider how
common it is among similar bodies in the Solar System. Plate
tectonics is a style of convection for an active planetoid where
lid fragment (plate) motions reflect sinking of dense lithosphere
in subduction zones, causing upwelling of asthenosphere at
divergent plate boundaries and accompanied by focused upwellings,
or mantle plumes; any other tectonic style is usefully called
``stagnant lid'' or ``fragmented lid''. In 2015 humanity
completed a 50+ year effort to survey the 30 largest planets,
asteroids, satellites, and inner Kuiper Belt objects, which we
informally call ``planetoids'' and use especially images of these
bodies to infer their tectonic activity. The four largest
planetoids are enveloped in gas and ice (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune) and are not considered. The other 26 planetoids
range in mass over 5 orders of magnitude and in diameter over 2
orders of magnitude, from massive Earth down to tiny Proteus;
these bodies also range widely in density, from 1000 to 5500
kg/m3. A gap separates 8 silicate planetoids with density = 3000
kg/m3or greater from 20 icy planetoids (including the gaseous and
icy giant planets) with density = 2200 kg/m3 or less. We define
the ``Tectonic Activity Index'' (TAI), scoring each body from 0
to 3 based on evidence for recent volcanism, deformation, and
resurfacing (inferred from impact crater density). Nine
planetoids with TAI = 2 or greater are interpreted to be
tectonically and convectively active whereas 17 with TAI <2 are
inferred to be tectonically dead. We further infer that active
planetoids have lithospheres or icy shells overlying
asthenosphere or water/weak ice. TAI of silicate (rocky)
planetoids positively correlates with their inferred Rayleigh
number. We conclude that some type of stagnant lid tectonics is
the dominant mode of heat loss and that plate tectonics is
unusual. To make progress understanding Earth's tectonic history
and the tectonic style of active exoplanets, we need to better
understand the range and controls of active stagnant lid
tectonics.",

abstract="Abstract Geodynamic modelling of Hadean/Eoarchaean tectonics
typically requires higher rates of internal heat production, and
higher mantle temperatures, in models that possess
temperature-dependent viscosity and a yield criterion. In such
models under Hadean conditions, for a wide range of geodynamic
configurations and modelling approaches, subduction has a
propensity to fail. This has led to the suggestion that the
predominant tectonic regime in the Hadean was stagnant-lid
convection, with intermittent recycling events. Various lines of
evidence support this suggestion, from i) the long mixing time of
mantle isotopic anomalies or compositional heterogeneities, such
as 142Nd, 182W, and platinum group elements, to ii) the long
residence time of the Hadean protolith to the Jack Hills zircons,
and iii) thermal evolution models, which typically require lower
heat flux in the past to avoid the ``Archaean thermal
catastrophe''. The framework provided by stagnant lid, or
episodic overturn, convection, iv) provides an explanation for
the formation of early Archaean TTGs and greenstones, and v)
explains the interleaving arc-plume sequence observed in many
Archaean terranes, suggesting subduction initiation events may
have been common, increasing their preservation potential.

Effects of internal heating rate, Rayleigh number, and plate
representation",
author="Shiels, C and Butler, S L",
abstract="Abstract Mantle convection models with a low viscosity
asthenosphere and high viscosity surface plates have been shown
to produce very large aspect ratio convection cells like those
inferred to exist in Earth's mantle and to exhibit two
asthenospheric flow regimes. When the surface plate is highly
mobile, the plate velocity exceeds the flow velocities in the
asthenosphere and the plate drives a Couette-type flow in the
asthenospheric channel. For sluggish plates, the flow velocities
in the asthenosphere exceed the plate velocity and the
asthenospheric flow is more Poiseuille-like. It has been shown
that under certain circumstances, flows become increasingly
Couette-like as the aspect ratio of the plate is increased in
numerical simulations. These models also show an increase in the
average surface heat flux with aspect ratio which is
counterintuitive, as one would expect that large aspect ratio
models would result in older and colder oceanic lithosphere.
Previous investigations have used single internal heating rates
and Rayleigh numbers and a plate formulation that did not
preclude significant deformation within the plate. In this paper,
we investigate the conditions necessary for Couette and
Poiseuille asthenospheric flows and for surface heat flux to
increase with plate aspect ratio by varying the internal heating
rate, the Rayleigh number and the representation of surface
plates in 2D mantle convection models Plates are represented as a
high viscosity layer with (1) a free-slip top surface boundary
condition and (2) a force-balance boundary condition that imposes
a constant surface velocity within the plate. We find that for
models with a free-slip surface boundary condition, the internal
heating rate and Rayleigh number do not strongly affect the
dominance of Couette or Poiseuille flows in the asthenosphere but
the increase in surface heat flux with model aspect ratio in the
Poiseuille asthenospheric flow regime increases with internal
heating rate. For models using the force-balance representation
of surface plates, the flow regime in the asthenosphere is found
to be almost independent of the plate aspect ratio and spatially
averaged surface heat flux decreases with increasing aspect
ratio. The dependence of heat flux on plate aspect ratio is an
important consideration in Earth's thermal history while the
preponderance of Poiseuille or Couette flows in the asthenosphere
may be important for understanding the mobility of surface plates

convective systems, a tool for assessing habitability of
exoplanets",
author="Vilella, Kenny and Kaminski, Edouard",
abstract="Abstract The long-term habitability of a planet rises from its
ability to generate and maintain an atmosphere through partial
melting and volcanism. This question has been mainly addressed in
the framework of plate tectonics, which may be too specific to
apply to the wide range of internal dynamics expected for
exoplanets, and even to the thermal evolution of the early Earth.
Here we propose a more general theoretical approach of convection
to build a regime diagram giving the conditions for partial
melting to occur, in planetary bodies, as a function of key
parameters that can be estimated for exoplanets, their size and
internal heating rate. To that aim, we introduce a refined view
of the Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL) in a convective system heated
from within, that focuses on the temperature and thickness of the
TBL at the top of the hottest temperature profiles, along which
partial melting shall first occur. This ``Hottest Thermal
Boundary Layer'' (HotTBL) is first characterized using fully
theoretical scaling laws based on the dynamics of thermal
boundary layers. These laws are the first ones proposed in the
literature that do not rely on empirical determinations of
dimensionless constants and that apply to both low Rayleigh and
high Rayleigh convective regimes. We show that the scaling laws
can be successfully applied to planetary bodies by comparing
their predictions to full numerical simulations of the Moon. We
then use the scaling laws to build a regime diagram for
exoplanets. Combined with estimates of internal heating in
exoplanets, the regime diagram predicts that in the habitable
zone partial melting occurs in planets younger than the Earth.",

combines equilibrium chemistry in evolving discs with core
accretion that tracks materials accreted on to planets during
their formation. In doing so, we aim to explain why super Earths
form so frequently and how they acquire such a diverse range of
compositions. A key feature of our model is disc inhomogeneities,
or planet traps, that act as barriers to rapid type-I migration.
The traps we include are the dead zone, which can be caused by
either cosmic ray or X-ray ionization, the ice line, and the heat
transition. We find that in discs with sufficiently long
lifetimes (≳4 Myr), all traps produce Jovian planets. In these
discs, planet formation in the heat transition and X-ray dead
zone produces hot Jupiters, while the ice line and cosmic ray
dead zones produce Jupiters at roughly 1 au. Super Earth
formation takes place within short-lived discs (≲2 Myr), whereby
the discs are photoevaporated while planets are in a slow phase
of gas accretion. We find that super Earth compositions range
from dry and rocky (30 per cent ice by mass). The traps play a
crucial role in our results, as they dictate where in the disc

interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences
about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We
present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly

diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior
compositions for planets with four layers (iron core,
silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We
apply our model to CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b.
Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by
the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for
CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further
find that our planet interior model sharpens the
observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and radius,
assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of
water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that
can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the
planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties,
high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition
constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from
Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a
formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical
and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's

might correspond with major tectonic eras, and that early mantle
overturns may have caused global magmatic and tectonic
convulsions. For the more plausible parameter values, the models

unstable and breaks down episodically via mantle overturns.
Subsequently the models evolve into whole-mantle convection due
to the increasing ability of subducted plates to penetrate the
phase barrier as the mantle cools, consistent with geophysical
evidence against strong layering of the present mantle. The early
layering-overturn cycles may occur on timescales of a few hundred
million years. The overturns replace cooler upper mantle material
with hotter lower mantle material, and would cause global
convulsions that potentially correspond with episodes of crust
formation. Such models permit plate tectonics to operate in the
Archean between overturns, though the early crust may record
mainly the effects of overturns, which could generate, aggregate

abstract="We first consider how the level of turbulence in a
protoplanetary disk affects the formation locations for the
observed close-in super-Earths in exosolar systems. We find
that a protoplanetary disk that includes a dead zone (a
region of low turbulence) has substantially more material in
the inner parts of the disk, possibly allowing for in situ
formation. For the dead zone to last the entire lifetime of
the disk requires the active layer surface density to be
sufficiently small, <100 g/cm^2. Migration through a dead
zone may be very slow and thus super-Earth formation
followed by migration towards the star through the dead zone
is less likely. For fully turbulent disks, there is not
enough material for in situ formation. However, in this
case, super-Earths can form farther out in the disk and
migrate inwards on a reasonable timescale. We suggest that
both of these formation mechanisms operate in different
planetary systems. This can help to explain the observed
large range in densities of super-Earths because the
formation location determines the composition. Furthermore,
we speculate that super-Earths could have formed in the
inner parts of our solar system and cleared the material in
the region inside of Mercury's orbit. The super-Earths could
migrate through the gas disk and fall into the Sun if the
disk was sufficiently cool during the final gas disk
accretion process. While it is definitely possible to meet
all of these requirements, we don't expect them to occur in
all systems, which may explain why the solar system is

abstract="Reconstructing the thermal history of the Earth, consistent with
the low concentration of heat-producing elements in convecting
mantle as well as with modest secular cooling required by
geological records, has been a major challenge in geophysics and
geochemistry. By developing the self-consistent energetics of
plate-tectonic mantle convection, we show that the low Urey ratio
of convecting mantle can yield a geologically reasonable solution
in the thermal evolution model of the Earth. The effect of
dehydration on mantle rheology during plate formation with mantle
melting results in more sluggish plate tectonics (i.e., lower
heat flow) for hotter mantle. This inverse relationship between
mantle temperature and surface heat flux leads to the efficient
storage of fossil heat, preventing the drastic secular cooling of

Implications for the cooling of the Earth",
author="Grign{\'e}, C and Labrosse, S and Tackley, P J",
abstract="Attempting to reconstruct the thermal history of the Earth from a
geophysical point of view has for a long time been in
disagreement with geochemical data. The geophysical approach uses
parameterized models of mantle cooling. The rate of cooling of
the Earth at the beginning of its history obtained in these
models is generally too rapid to allow a sufficient present-day
secular cooling rate. Geochemical estimates of radioactive
element concentrations in the mantle then appear too low to
explain the observed present mantle heat loss. Cooling models use
scaling laws for the mean heat flux out of the mantle as a
function of its Rayleigh number of the form Q ∝ Ra$\beta$. Recent
studies have introduced very low values of the exponent $\beta$,
which can help reduce the cooling rate of the mantle. The present
study instead focuses on the coefficient C in the relation Q = C
Ra$\beta$ and, in particular, on its variation with the
wavelength of convection. The heat transfer strongly depends on
the wavelength of convection. The length scale of convection in
Earth's mantle is that of plate tectonics, implying convective
cells of wide aspect ratio. Taking into account the long
wavelength of convection in Earth's mantle can significantly
reduce the efficiency of heat transfer. The likely variations of
this wavelength with the Wilson cycle thus imply important
variations of the heat flow out of the Earth on a intermediate
timescale of 100 Ma, which renders parameterized models of
thermal evolution inaccurate for quantitative predictions.",

title="A mantle convection perspective on global tectonics",
author="Coltice, Nicolas and G{\'e}rault, M{\'e}lanie and Ulvrov{\'a},
Martina",
abstract="Abstract The concept of interplay between mantle convection and
tectonics goes back to about a century ago, with the proposal
that convection currents in the Earth's mantle drive continental
drift and deformation (Holmes, 1931). Since this time, plate
tectonic theory has established itself as the fundamental
framework to study surface deformation, with the remarkable
ability to encompass geological and geophysical observations.
Mantle convection modeling has progressed to the point where
connections with plate tectonics can be made, pushing the idea
that tectonics is a surface expression of the global dynamics of
one single system: the mantle-lithosphere system. Here, we
present our perspective, as modelers, on the dynamics behind
global tectonics with a focus on the importance of
self-organisation. We first present an overview of the links
between mantle convection and tectonics at the present-day,
examining observations such as kinematics, stress and
deformation. Despite the numerous achievements of geodynamic
studies, this section sheds light on the lack of
self-organisation of the models used, which precludes
investigations of the feedbacks and evolution of the
mantle-lithosphere system. Therefore, we review the modeling
strategies, often focused on rheology, that aim at taking into
account self-organisation. The fundamental objective is that
plate-like behaviour emerges self-consistently in convection
models. We then proceed with the presentation of studies of
continental drift, seafloor spreading and plate tectonics in
convection models allowing for feedbacks between surface
tectonics and mantle dynamics. We discuss the approximation of
the rheology of the lithosphere used in these models
(pseudo-plastic rheology), for which empirical parameters differ
from those obtained in experiments. In this section, we analyse
in detail a state-of-the-art 3-D spherical convection
calculation, which exhibits fundamental tectonic features
(continental drift, one-sided subduction, trench and ridge
evolution, transform shear zones, small-scale convection, and
plume tectonics). This example leads to a discussion where we try
to answer the following question: can mantle convection models
transcend the limitations of plate tectonic theory?",

of the Gliese 581 exoplanetary system. The system is known to
harbour four planets (b--e). The existence of another planet (g)
in the liquid water habitable zone of the star is debated after
the latest analyses of the radial velocity (RV) measurements. We
integrated the four- and five-planet model of Vogt et al. with
initial circular orbits. To characterize stability, the maximum
eccentricity was used that the planets reached over the time of
the integrations and the Lyapunov characteristic indicator and
relative Lyapunov indicator to identify chaotic motion. Since
circular orbits in the RV fits seem to be a too strong
restriction and the true orbits might be elliptic, we
investigated the stability of the planets as a function of their
eccentricity. The integration of the circular four-planet model
shows that it is stable on a longer time-scale for even an
inclination i = 5°, i.e. high planetary masses. A fifth planetary
body in the four-planet model could have a stable orbit between
the two super-Earth-sized planets c and d, and beyond the orbit
of planet d, although another planet would likely only be stable
on a circular or near-circular orbit in the habitable zone of the
star. Gliese 581 g in the five-planet model would have a
dynamically stable orbit, even for a wider range of orbital
parameters, but its stability is strongly dependent on the
eccentricity of planet d. The low-mass planet e, which quickly
became unstable in eccentric models, remains stable in the
circular four-planet model, but the stable region around its
initial semimajor axis and eccentricity is rather small. The
stability of the inner planets e and c is dependent on the
eccentricity of the Neptune-sized planet b. The outermost planet
d is far away from the adjacent planet c to considerably
influence its stability; however, the existence of a planet
between the two super-Earth planets c and d constrains its
eccentricity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

gravitational configuration of a dense molten metallic layer
overlying a cold chondritic protocore is predicted by most
studies, which leads to the formation of a Rayleigh--Taylor (RT)
instability. Recent results [Dahl, T.W., 2005. Turbulent mixing
during planet accretion and core formation: Interpretation of the
Hf/W chronometer and implications for the age of the Moon. M. Sc.
Thesis, University of Copenhagen.] indicate that additionally,
iron cores of predifferentiated planetesimals are also able to
plunge mostly intact into the cold protocore and create large
iron diapirs. For both scenarios we propose the application of
the stress-induced melt channelling mechanism [Stevenson, D.J.,
1989. Spontaneous small-scale melt segregation in partial melts
undergoing deformation. Geophys. Res. Lett. 16, 1,067--1,070] in
the region surrounding an incipient iron diapir. We therefore
perform numerical experiments solving the two-phase, two
composition flow equations within a 2D rectangular box with
symmetrical boundary conditions. We apply the Compaction
Boussinesq Approximation (CBA) and include a depth-dependent
gravity. For simplicity we use a constant viscosity for the solid
phase and a melt fraction dependent rheology for the partially
molten region around the diapir. We investigate the physical
conditions under which the melt channels can form and whether
they are applicable to the early Earth. As a result, for
sufficiently small melt retention numbers iron-rich melt channels
develop within a region of approximately twice the diapir's size.
This could lead to effective draining of the surrounding region
and might initiate cascading daughter diapirs. The region of the
protocore drained by this cascading mechanism is expected to
significantly increase with depth, and thus indicates an
effective mechanism to also extract iron melt from deeper parts
of the initially chondritic protocore. This mechanism could
effectively accelerate the process of core formation.",

incorporates much physics and several features including
compressibility, phase transitions, compositional variations,
non-linear rheology, parallelisation, tracers to track
composition, partial melting and melt migration, and the ability
to also model spherical patches, cartesian boxes, and various 2D

solver to obtain a velocity--pressure solution at each timestep
on a staggered grid, a finite-volume scheme for advection of
temperature and tracers to track composition. Convergence of
multigrid solvers in the presence of realistically large
viscosity variations has always been a problem; here a new
pressure interpolation scheme is presented that can dramatically
improve the robustness of the iterations to large viscosity
variations, with up to 19 orders of magnitude variation in
presented tests. Benchmark tests show that StagYY produces
results that are consistent with those produced by other codes.
Performance tests show reasonable scaling on a parallel Beowulf

abstract="The surface of Mars consists of an old, heavily cratered and

depressed northern hemisphere, a feature often termed the crustal
dichotomy. The global crustal structure [Zuber et al., 2000]
revealed by topography and gravity data from the Mars Global
Surveyor spacecraft, and the possible late formation of the
boundary zone between the hemispheres [McGill and Dimitriou,
1990], have been proposed to indicate an endogenic origin for the
dichotomy. However, degree-1 mantle convection that is required
for any endogenic process to be viable cannot be produced with
conventional mantle convection models [Schubert et al., 1990]. We
have studied the role of radially stratified viscosity on mantle
deformation by using Rayleigh--Taylor instability analyses in a
spherical shell geometry. Our analyses reveal that when mantle
viscosity is stratified with a weak asthenosphere, deformation at
long wavelengths is more efficient than that at short
wavelengths. The weaker the asthenosphere, the longer the
wavelength at which the deformation is the most efficient. A
thicker asthenosphere also favors the deformation at long
wavelengths. Both the Rayleigh--Taylor instability analyses and
numerical modeling of mantle convection show that degree-1
convection can be produced within the Martian mantle provided
that the mantle had a weak asthenosphere (∼500 km thick and ∼102
times weaker than the underlying mantle) early in planetary
history. The degree-1 convection causes preferential heating of
one hemisphere that may explain the primary features associated

variations associated with the dichotomy may have driven true
polar wander, establishing the north--south orientation of the
dichotomy very early in martian history. Such a reorientation
that placed the dichotomy boundary near the equator would also
have constrained the Tharsis region on the dichotomy boundary to
have originated near the equator. We present a scenario for the
early generation and subsequent reorientation of the hemispheric
dichotomy, although the reorientation is independent of the
formation mechanism. Our results also have implications for the
sharply different remanent magnetizations between the two

abstract="In order to find an explanation for the origin of the martian
crustal dichotomy, a number of recent papers have examined the
effect of layered viscosity on the evolution of a degree-1 mantle

[Yoshida, M., Kageyama, A., 2006. J. Geophys. Res. 111,

viscosity jump, combined with highly temperature- and
depth-dependent rheology, are effective in developing a degree-1
convection within a short timescale. Such a layered viscosity
profile could be justified by martian mineralogy. However, the
effect of a degree-1 convective planform on the crustal thickness
distribution has not yet been demonstrated. It is not obvious
whether a thinner crust, due to sublithospheric erosion and
crustal thinning, or a thicker crust, due to enhanced crustal
production, would form above the hemisphere of mantle upwelling.
Also, the general shape of the dichotomy, which is not strictly
hemispherical, has not yet been fully investigated. Here we
propose a model of the crustal patterns produced by numerical
simulations of martian mantle convection, using the finite-volume
multigrid code StagYY [Tackley, P.J., 2008. Phys. Earth Planet.

global maps of the crustal thickness distribution as it evolves

possible to form a crustal dichotomy as a consequence of near
degree-1 mantle convection early in Mars' history. We find that
some of the observed patterns show intriguing first order
similarities to the elliptical shape of the martian dichotomy. In
all models, the region of thick crust is located over the region
of mantle upwelling, which itself is a ridge-like structure

Mountains of the northern Wyoming Province of western North
America comprise the Long Lake Magmatic Complex (LLMC), a
variably metamorphosed and deformed association of igneous and

78 wt\%. Within this compositional range, rock types include
lineated amphibolites to hornblende-bearing gneisses of
intermediate composition and multiple generations of foliated to
unfoliated granitoids. Emplacement ages range between
approximately 2.79 and 2.83 Ga, based on U--Pb zircon

and geochronology indicate that these rocks do not represent a
single fractional crystallization sequence, but rather, the LLMC

sill-like bodies over an ∼40 Ma period. Although there is a
continuum of compositions in the LLMC, trace element abundances
can be used to distinguish distinct sources and petrogenetic
processes that can be broadly extrapolated to at least 3

abundances similar to modern convergent margin magmas. Initial Sr

title="Sea level changes and the continental freeboard concept: general
principles and application to the Precambrian",
author="Eriksson, P G",
abstract="Eustatic sea level changes reflect variation in ocean water or
ocean basin volume, or changes to the hypsometric curve, which is
in itself geographically and chronologically variable. Freeboard,
the elevation of a continent above mean sea level, is closely
related to changes in both sea level and this curve. Relative sea
level change occurs due to tectonism, sediment supply,
compaction, and eustatic movements. Hydroisostatic compensation
modifies first-order sea level variation by about one-third.
Short term and localised change in sea level may be ascribed to
waves and tides, storm winds, hurricanes, tsunamis and
catastrophic sediment slumps. Wide, gently sloping shelves with
more uniform circulation systems, inferred for the Precambrian,
may have enhanced tide and wave-induced sea level changes.
Salinity and water temperature, mutually dependent, affect
eustatic and relative sea levels; elevated water temperatures
postulated for the early Precambrian would have been offset
partly by enhanced evaporation and increased salinity. Longer
term changes in sea level, regional or eustatic, may result from
orogenesis, volcanism, sediment supply, compaction and loading,
isostasy, and thermal mechanisms. Glacioeustatic changes,
compounded by related salinity variations, moderated by
glacioisostatic effects and modified by hydroisostasy, reach ca
150 m. Isostatic rebound in interglacial episodes will produce
rapid and marked sea level drops up to ca 250 m; this is a
localised effect and contrasts with the global enhancement of sea
level during interglacials. However, evidence for glaciation in
the geological record is limited, also for most of the
Precambrian; sea level oscillations in non-glacial episodes may
reflect flexure of tectonic plates (change up to ∼100 m) or
changes to Earth's geoid (∼250 m). Eustasy up to ∼350 m will
result from change to ocean basin volume, due to variation in
mid-ocean ridge volume and spreading rates, also related to
supercontinent amalgamation and breakup. Intra-plate hot spots
and oceanic plateaus will change eustatic sea level more slowly,
up to ∼100 m. Higher heat flow in the Archaean and concomitant
enhanced volcanism suggest that these were important influences
on Precambrian sea levels. The exponential elevation-age
relationship observed for Phanerozoic oceanic lithosphere may
have been more significant in the Precambrian. As continental
crust grew from ca 4.0 Ga, declining heat flow and concomitant
deepening of the ocean basins maintained an approximately
constant freeboard during the Archaean. Although still hotly
debated, there is strong support for episodic growth models
inferring rapid formation of continental crust near the
Archaean--Proterozoic boundary. This would imply constant
freeboard conditions after 2.5 Ga as well. The constant freeboard
model, however, is one based on average global conditions.
Freeboard was still subject to geographic and chronologic
variation, and these potential changes lie within the bounds of
eustatic and relative sea level change. Continental crustal

author="Vlaar, N J",
abstract="Isostasy considerations are connected to a 1-D model of mantle
differentiation due to pressure release partial melting to obtain
a model for the evolution of the relative sea level with respect
to the continent during the earth secular cooling. In this
context, a new mechanism is derived for the selective exhumation
of exposed ancient cratons. The model results in a quantitative
scenario for sea-level fall due to the changing thicknesses of
the oceanic basaltic crust and its harzburgite residual layer as
a function of falling mantle temperature. It is also shown that
the buoyancy of the harzburgite root of a stabilized continental
craton has an important effect on sea-level and on the isostatic
readjustment and exhumation of exposed continental surface during
the earth's secular cooling. The model does not depend on the
usual assumption of constant continental freeboard and crustal
thickness and its application is not restricted to the
post-Archaean. It predicts large-scale continental emergence near
the end of the Archaean and the early Proterozoic. This provides
an explanation for reported late Archaean emergence and the
subsequent formation of late Archaean cratonic platforms and
early Proterozoic sedimentary basins. For a period of secular
cooling of 3.8 Ga, corresponding to the length of the geological
record, the model predicts a fall of the ocean floor of some 4 km
or more. For a constant ocean depth, this implies a sea-level
fall of the same magnitude. A formula is derived that allows for
an increasing ocean depth due to either the changing ratio of
continental with respect to oceanic area, or to a possible
increase of the oceanic volume during the geological history.
Increasing ocean depth results in a later emergence of submarine
ancient geological formations compared to the case when ocean
depth is constant. Selective exhumation is studied for the case
of constant ocean depth. It is shown that for this case, early
exposed continental crust can be exhumed to a lower crustal
depth, which explains the relative vertical displacement of
low-grade- with respect to high-grade terrain. Increasing ocean
depth is not expected to result in diminished exhumation.

abstract="Over long enough time scales, an antagonistic balance acting
between tectonics (uplift and rifting) and the sedimentary cycle
(erosion and deposition) probably keeps continental surfaces
close to sea level. We argue that this balance constitutes the
primary mechanism for keeping long-term continental freeboard
constant by regulating the continental thickness. An important
implication is that the long-term uplift or down-warp history of
ancient continental segments provides direct information on
secular changes in the isostasy of the adjacent ocean basins
through time. The amount of uplift can be estimated from the
regional metamorphic grade. The burial pressures at present
exposure of ten undisturbed Archean granite--greenstone segments
are estimated to be ∼1.5$\pm$0.5 kb. From this, we infer a
maximum long-term uplift and erosion of 5$\pm$2 km for stable
continent since ∼3.0 Ga, implying a mean continental thickness of
∼46 km at the time of crustal stabilization. For a constant mean
ocean depth, isostasy requires a palaeo-oceanic crust 14$\pm$2 km
thick in the middle Archean. Alternatively, if little continent
existed then, the oceans would have been shallower and the
palaeo-oceanic crust 21$\pm$2 km thick. Assuming plate spreading
did occur in the Archean, potential temperatures in the shallow
mantle at ∼3 Ga were 90$\pm$30°C (or 170$\pm$20°C for no
continent) hotter than those prevailing today. These temperatures
translate into `time averaged' cooling rates for the shallow
mantle of ∼57°C Ga−1 and are comparable to estimates of the
present-day cooling rate for the whole Earth. The low burial
pressures are a strong argument against the existence of
catastrophic mantle flush events in the geological past which
have been predicted by some mantle convection models. Taken
together, these constraints suggest a plume-related geological

mantle-derived igneous products that will eventually form the
continental crust (protolith), the episodic nature, and the
geodynamic sites of crustal growth are discussed. Models in which
crustal growth takes place at converging boundaries from orogenic
magmas contrast with those in which basaltic plume material is
involved (underplating, loose-plate loading, oceanic plateaus).
Because some chemical components of the crust are either
preferentially returned to the mantle at subduction zones (Mg,
Ca) or sequestered in the crust (Si, Al, Na, K), the composition
of the crust and that of its protolith are probably very
different. Continental crust may therefore form from basaltic
magmas and not necessarily from intermediate (e.g., andesitic)
magmas. Because subduction is a continuous process, the episodic
pattern of crust formation ages is a strong argument against
crustal growth at converging boundaries. The preferred model is
based on major mantle instabilities (superplumes) and their
surface expression, the oceanic plateaus where thick piles of
plume basalts rapidly erupted on the ocean floor reach the
buoyancy threshold that defines the status of continental crust.
The plateaus are accreted against the continents, and the felsic
magmas that stand out as the most conspicuous feature of
continental crust chemistry, are produced subsequently upon
subduction erosion and possibly by gravitational instability of
thin hot young lithospheric plates.  1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

plausible values of 〈T〉c, the isotopic compositions of modern

non-uniform depletion of the mantle previously inferred from

freeboard (i.e., sea level) on the continents has fluctuated by
only around $\pm$0.5 km from the middle Archean to the present.
The magnitude and interplay of the various contributing factors
have been examined by combining the plate model of the oceanic
lithosphere with parameterizations of ocean crustal thickness
based upon isentropic melting beneath spreading ridges. For a
constant thickness continental crust and constant volume ocean,
freeboard depends upon the (1) volume of continental crust,
$\varphi$c, (2) production rate of new ocean floor, C0 (km2 a−1),
(3) thickness of the oceanic lithosphere, a (km), and (4) mantle
potential temperature, Tp (°C). The thickness of the oceanic
crust probably exerts the strongest influence through isostatic
readjustment of the continents, and is a strong function of
mantle potential temperature. Freeboard changes are illustrated
graphically, and solutions are presented among these parameters
explicitly for the case of constant freeboard. Criteria for ocean
ridge crests to be raised above ambient sea level are also
presented. The principal results are the following: (1) Freeboard
is especially sensitive to aesthenospheric mantle potential
temperature. A reasonable balance of the parameters maintains
constant freeboard if Tp never exceeded ∼ 1430°C (i.e., ∼ 150°C
greater than today). (2) A middle Archean ( ∼ 3.5 Ga) continental
crust of comparable size to today is possible only if Tp was
within ∼ 50°C of its present value. (3) The crests of ocean
ridges have probably always remained below sea level, though this
is still not completely certain. (4) Sometime prior to ∼ 3.8 Ga,
potential temperatures must have been greater than 1600°C in the
shallow mantle. In such circumstances, there can have been little
hypsometric or tectonic distinction between ``continental'' and
``oceanic'' regimes at the Earth's surface. If any continental

abstract="A three reservoir model, consisting of the continental crust,
depleted mantle and a more primitive mantle reservoir is used as
a basis to account for both the present-day as well as the
evolving isotopic compositions of the Earth's crust and mantle.
The rate of growth of the continental crust is used as an input
parameter to constrain the concomitant growth and evolution of
the depleted mantle reservoir. Recycling of large volumes of bulk
continental crust into the mantle is not considered to be an
important process, nor is the existence of an additional major
enriched reservoir in the early Archean mantle. This relatively
simple model of progressively growing continental crust extracted
from an increasing volume of depleted mantle can account for the
positive ϵNd values which characterise the Archean depleted
mantle, the evolution of the strontium, neodymium, hafnium and
lead isotopic systems as well as the budgets of a wide range of
trace elements in the continental crust and depleted mantle;
e.g., the nonprimitive Rb/Cs, Nb/U and Th/U observed in MORBs and
OIBs as well as the Sm/Nd in the crust and mantle can be
reproduced. The Re-Os isotopic system is most sensitive to the
formation of basaltic crust in the early Archean and can
potentially provide definitive limits on the volumes of stored
mafic or ultramafic crust in the mantle. To account for the
relatively radiogenic 206Pb204Pb ratios of modern MORB it is
necessary to assume that the overall efficiency of transfer of
uranium from the mantle to the crust has decreased markedly since
the Archean, a proposed consequence of slab dehydration rather
than slab melting. In the post-Archean period, recycling of
hydrothermally altered oceanic crust is thus likely to have had a
significant influence on the lead isotopic systematics of the
mantle. In the model described here it is assumed that the volume
of depleted mantle increases in a stepwise manner which is
arbitrarily linked to major episodes of rapid crustal formation.
From observed crustal age distribution patterns, episodes of
rapid crustal formation with high ϵNd values occur at ~3600 Ma,
~2700 Ma and 1800 Ma. Thus, in our first order calculations, the
crust is modelled as being extracted from ~10\% of the mass of
the mantle (upper 220 km) from 4500 Ma to 3600 Ma, ~20\% (upper
410 km) from 3600 Ma to 2700 Ma, ~30\% (upper 660 km) from 2700
Ma to 1800 Ma and 40\% to 50\% (upper 800--1000 km) of the mantle
from 1800 Ma to the present-day. This type of model with growing
volumes of both continental crust and depleted mantle has the
general effect of buffering the isotopic and trace element
composition of the upper mantle through time to an approximately
constant, but incompatible element depleted chemical composition.",

and Earth's thermal efficiency",
author="Hynes, Andrew",
abstract="The rate of growth of Earth's continental crust is commonly
estimated from the age distribution of present continental crust
and from the geochemistry of ancient mantle-derived lavas. In
this paper, I assess the rate of growth from relationships
between the volume and thickness of continental crust. The
thickness of the continental crust is governed by its total
volume and by the relative buoyancy of the continental and
oceanic lithospheres. The buoyancy of the oceanic lithosphere is
governed by the amount of melting at mid-oceanic ridges and the
mean age of the ocean floor, which are functions of the mantle
temperature and its relationship to global heat loss. Thus, the
relationship between continental crustal thickness, continental
crustal volume and mantle temperature may be specified provided
the functional dependence of global heat loss on mantle
temperature is known. Using this relationship, I investigate the
implications of crustal growth models for changes in continental
crustal thickness over time. If Archean continental crustal
volumes had been the same as or similar to modern ones,
continental crustal thicknesses would have been significantly
greater than today. This would be reflected in subsequently
deeply eroded Archean terrains and is inconsistent with the
geological record. Sigmoidal growth models, in which significant
crustal growth occurred during the Proterozoic, also require
several kilometers of erosion for strong dependence of heat loss
on mantle temperature, but permit nearly constant continental
crustal thicknesses through time if the dependence is weak. With
more precise information on the erosion of Archean terrains, it
will be possible to constrain both crustal growth models and the
nature of the functional dependence of heat loss on mantle
temperature.",

mantle heat flow needs to be able to change rapidly relative to
the potential temperature, or, equivalently, lithosphere needs to
be a small fraction of the mass planet. This criterion is
satisfied by the Earth, Venus, and Mars, but not the Moon. At a
given potential temperature the function may be multivalued with
a separate branch representing each mode of convection. The heat
flow evolves along a branch as the potential temperature changes
depending on whether the heat flow is greater or less than the
global radioactive heat generation. When the end of a branch is
reached, the state of the system jumps to another branch, quickly
changing the global heat flow. Examples include transitions from
a magma ocean to plate tectonics, probably on the Earth and Mars,

author="Tsuchiya, Taku and Kawai, Kenji and Maruyama, Shigenori",
abstract="The Earth was born from a giant impact at 4.56 Ga. It is
generally thought that the Earth subsequently cooled, and hence
shrunk, over geologic time. However, if the Earth's convection
was double-layered, there must have been a peak of expansion
during uni-directional cooling. We computed the
expansion-contraction effect using first principles mineral
physics data. The result shows a radius about 120 km larger than
that of the present Earth immediately after the consolidation of
the magma-ocean on the surface, and subsequent shrinkage of
about 110 km in radius within about 10 m.y., followed by gradual
expansion of 11 km in radius due to radiogenic heating in the
lower mantle in spite of cooling in the upper mantle in the
Archean. This was due to double-layered convection in the
Archean with final collapse of overturn with contraction of
about 8 km in radius, presumably by the end of the Archean.
Since then, the Earth has gradually cooled down to reduce its
radius by around 12 km. Geologic evidence supports the late
Archean mantle overturn ca. 2.6 Ga, such as the global
distribution of super-liquidus flood basalts on nearly all
cratonic fragments (>35 examples). If our inference is correct,
the surface environment of the Earth must have undergone
extensive volcanism and emergence of local landmasses, because
of the thin ocean cover (3--5 km thickness). Global unconformity
appeared in cratonic fragments with stromatolite back to 2.9 Ga
with a peak at 2.6 Ga. The global magmatism brought extensive
crustal melting to yield explosive felsic volcanism to transport
volcanic ash into the stratosphere during the catastrophic
mantle overturn. This event seems to be recorded by sulfur
mass-independent fractionation (SMIF) at 2.6 Ga. During the
mantle overturn, a number of mantle plumes penetrated into the
upper mantle and caused local upward doming of by ca. 2--3 km
which raised local landmasses above sea-level. The consequent
increase of atmospheric oxygen enabled life evolution from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes by 2.1 Ga, or even earlier in the

abstract="Abstract A distinctive flow deposit southwest of Cerberus Fossae
on Mars is analyzed. The flow source is a ∼20 m deep, ∼12
$\times$ 1.5 km wide depression within a yardang associated with
the Medusae Fossae Formation. The flow traveled for ∼40 km
following topographic lows to leave a deposit on average 3--4 km
wide. The surface morphology of the deposit suggests that it was
produced by the emplacement of a fluid flowing in a laminar
fashion and possessing a finite yield strength. We use
topographic data from a digital elevation model (DEM) to model
the dynamics of the motion and infer that the fluid had a
Bingham rheology with a plastic viscosity of ∼1 Pa s and a yield
strength of ∼185 Pa. Although the low viscosity is consistent
with the properties of komatiite-like lava, the combination of
values of viscosity and yield strength, as well as the surface
morphology of the flow, suggests that this was a mud flow.
Comparison with published experimental data implies a solids
content close to 60\% by volume and a grain size dominated by
silt-size particles. Comparison of the ∼1.5 km3 deposit volume
with the ∼0.03 km3 volume of the source depression implies that
∼98\% of the flow material was derived from depth in the crust.
There are similarities between the deposit studied here, which
we infer to be mud, and other flow deposits on Mars currently
widely held to be lavas. This suggests that a re-appraisal of
many of these deposits is now in order.",

abstract="We have examined thermal emission from 240 active or
recently-active volcanic features on Io and quantified the
magnitude and distribution of their volcanic heat flow during
the Galileo epoch. We use spacecraft data and a geological map
of Io to derive an estimate of the maximum possible contribution
from small dark areas not detected as thermally active but which
nevertheless appear to be sites of recent volcanic activity. We
utilize a trend analysis to extrapolate from the smallest
detectable volcanic heat sources to these smallest mapped dark
areas. Including the additional heat from estimates for
``outburst'' eruptions and for a multitude of very small
(``myriad'') hot spots, we account for ∼62 $\times$ 1012 W (∼59
$\pm$ 7\% of Io's total thermal emission). Loki Patera
contributes, on average, 9.6 $\times$ 1012 W (∼9.1 $\pm$ 1\%).
All dark paterae contribute 45.3 $\times$ 1012 W (∼43 $\pm$
5\%). Although dark flow fields cover a much larger area than
dark paterae, they contribute only 5.6 $\times$ 1012 W (∼5.3
$\pm$ 0.6\%). Bright paterae contribute ∼2.6 $\times$ 1012 W
(∼2.5 $\pm$ 0.3\%). Outburst eruption phases and very small hot
spots contribute no more than ∼4\% of Io's total thermal
emission: this is probably a maximum value. About 50\% of Io's
volcanic heat flow emanates from only 1.2\% of Io's surface. Of
Io's heat flow, 41 $\pm$ 7.0\% remains unaccounted for in terms
of identified sources. Globally, volcanic heat flow is not
uniformly distributed. Power output per unit surface area is
slightly biased towards mid-latitudes, although there is a
stronger bias toward the northern hemisphere when Loki Patera is
included. There is a slight favoring of the northern hemisphere
for outbursts where locations were well constrained. Globally,
we find peaks in thermal emission at ∼315°W and ∼105°W (using
30° bins). There is a minimum in thermal emission at around
200°W (almost at the anti-jovian longitude) which is a
significant regional difference. These peaks and troughs suggest
a shift to the east from predicted global heat flow patterns
resulting from tidal heating in an asthenosphere. Global
volcanic heat flow is dominated by thermal emission from
paterae, especially from Loki Patera (312°W, 12°N). Thermal
emission from dark flows maximises between 165°W and 225°W.
Finally, it is possible that a multitude of very small hot
spots, smaller than the present angular resolution detection
limits, and/or cooler, secondary volcanic processes involving
sulphurous compounds, may be responsible for at least part of
the heat flow that is not associated with known sources. Such
activity should be sought out during the next mission to Io.",

abstract="Abstract. Layered viscosity, temperature-dependent viscosity, and
surface plates have an important effect on the scale and
morphology of structure in spherical models of mantle convection.
We find that long-wavelength structures can be produced either by
a layered viscosity with a weak upper mantle or
temperature-dependent viscosity even in the absence of surface
plates, corroborating earlier studies. However, combining the
layered viscosity structure with a temperature-dependent
viscosity results in structure with significantly shorter
wavelengths. Our models show that the scale of convection is
mainly controlled by the surface plates, supporting the previous
two-dimensional studies. Our models with surface plates, layered
and temperaturedependent viscosity, and internal heating explain
mantle structures inferred from seismic tomography. The models
show that hot upwellings initiate at the core-mantle boundary
(CMB) with linear structures, and as they depart from CMB, the
linear upwellings quickly change into quasi-cylindrical plumes
that dynamically interact with the ambient mantle and surface
plates while ascending through the mantle. A linear upwelling
structure is generated again at shallow depths (<200 km) in the
vicinity of diverging plate margins because of the surface
plates. At shallow depths, cold downwelling sheets form at
converging plate margins. The evolution of downwelling sheets
depends on the mantle rheology. The temperature-dependent
viscosity strengthens the downwelling sheets so that the sheet
structure can be maintained throughouthe mantle. The tendency for
linear upwelling and downwelling structures to break into
plume-like structures is stronger at higher Rayleigh numbers. Our
models also show that downwellings to first-order control surface
plate motions and the locations and horizontal motion of
upwellings. Upwellings tend to form at stagnation points
predicted solely from the buoyancy forces of downwellings.
Temperature-dependent viscosity greatly enhances the ascending
velocity of developed upwelling plumes, and this may reduce the
influence of global mantle flow on the motion of plumes. Our
results can explain the anticorrelation between hotspot
distribution and fast seismic wave speed anomalies in the lower
mantle and may also have significant implications to the observed
stationarity of hotspots.",

hydrocarbon fluid channelization forming the Elivagar Flumina
channel network and dune fields resulting from aeolian activity
are the current geologic processes dominating our map area, and
these processes have contributed to the erosion of the crater's
ejecta field. There is evidence of multiple episodes of channel
formation, erosion and burial by aeolian deposits, as observed
elsewhere on Titan by e.g., Barnes et al. (Barnes, J.W. et al.
[2005]. Icarus 195, 400--414). Channel outflow regions have
morphologies suggestive of streams formed by flash floods, and
dune fields are small and restricted rather than forming large
dune seas, consistent with a desert-like environment for this
region with low supply of hydrocarbon particles, also consistent
with other studies by e.g., Lorenz et al. (Lorenz, R.D. et al.

evidence of cryovolcanism or non-impact-related tectonic
activity in the Menrva region, although this region is too small

confidently be applied to Cassini RADAR data, and we suggest

temperature variations measured by Cassini {CIRS}",

abstract="Abstract Structural and thermal properties of Saturn's B ring
and its particles are derived from orbital and seasonal
temperatures variations observed by the Cassini CIRS
spectrometer between 2004 and 2009 equinox. Our multiscale
thermal model (Ferrari, C., Reffet, E. [2013]. Icarus 223,
28--39), which assumes negligible heat transfer by vertical
motion of particles in dense rings, is adjusted to the data.
Most observations were focused on the center of the B ring, at
105,000 km from Saturn. A very good fit is obtained for
conductive particles embedded in a moderately conductive ring
medium. Assuming a bulk composition of water ice, the thermal
inertia of particles is found to be $\Gamma$ 1 = 160 -- 200 J /
m 2 / K / s 1 / 2 and to vary with seasons as part of the heat
transfer is radiative, then temperature-dependent. For the same
reason, the thermal inertia of the ring, $\Gamma$ 0 , varies
with seasons, between 30 and 35 J / m 2 / K / s 1 / 2 . It is
very comparable to the thermal inertia of icy satellite
surfaces. The porosity of particles p 1 found to fit this
thermal inertia is very high (0.93) and may emphasize an
inappropriate modeling of particles by an effective porous
medium. The ring filling factor is fairly high, D = 0.34 $\pm$
0.01 , but stays typical of a compact medium and compatible with
the output of numerical simulations of dense ring dynamics. The
thickness of the B ring at 105,000 km from Saturn is estimated
at H S = 2.2 $\pm$ 0.2 m. The observed correlation of its
optical depth with the thermal gradient between lit and unlit
sides is easily reproduced by the model if the radial variations
in optical depth are due to varying thickness H S ( a ) with
constant filling factor. This thickness varies between 1 and 3 m
across the B 2 , B 3 and B 4 regions. It is thinner than the
neighboring C ring and Cassini Division. This can be understood
as a consequence of self-gravity. The ring surface mass density
$\Sigma$ = ( 1 - p 1 ) $\rho$ 0 DH S ( a ) derived from these
structural parameters is too low for a self-gravitating ring,
due to the high porosity found. But its radial variations, if
deduced from coupling H S ( a ) with known aspect-ratios H /
$\lambda$ of self-gravity wakes, range between 300 in the inner
B ring and most certainly exceed 1000 kg / m 2 in the B 3 ring,
values compatible with a self-gravitating ring. The inferred
minimum total mass of Saturn's rings is M R = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.2 · 10
19 kg, close to the mass expected for a viscous disk evolving
over the age of the Solar System and compatible with current
higher estimates.",

abstract="Abstract We use 3D mantle convection and planetary tectonics
models to explore the links between tectonic regimes and the
level of internal heating within the mantle of a planet (a proxy
for thermal age), planetary surface temperature, and lithosphere
strength. At both high and low values of internal heating, for
moderate to high lithospheric yield strength, hot and cold
stagnant-lid (single plate planet) states prevail. For
intermediate values of internal heating, multiple stable
tectonic states can exist. In these regions of parameter space,
the specific evolutionary path of the system has a dominant role
in determining its tectonic state. For low to moderate
lithospheric yield strength, mobile-lid behavior (a plate
tectonic-like mode of convection) is attainable for high degrees
of internal heating (i.e., early in a planet's thermal
evolution). However, this state is sensitive to climate driven
changes in surface temperatures. Relatively small increases in
surface temperature can be sufficient to usher in a transition
from a mobile- to a stagnant-lid regime. Once a stagnant-lid
mode is initiated, a return to mobile-lid is not attainable by a
reduction of surface temperatures alone. For lower levels of
internal heating, the tectonic regime becomes less sensitive to

abstract="Abstract Planetary surface mobility depends on lithospheric
stresses arising from the mantle's convective vigor. Using a
model of thermochemical convection featuring force-balanced
plates we examine the effect on surface mobility of different
fractions of compositionally dense mantle material.
Specifically, we introduce a uniform thickness compositionally
enriched basal layer in a system with mobile-lid tectonics and
monitor whether an active lid is subsequently maintained. We
find that long-term surface mobility decreases when enriched
material is present. High mobility is always maintained if the
total material volume is no more than 1\% of the mantle volume.
For the inferred volume of the Large Low Shear Velocity
Provinces in the present-day Earth surface mobility is dependent
on the buoyancy ratio of the enriched material. If the
compositionally dense material self-organizes into provinces,
both surface mobility and mantle upwelling vigor become more
variable. Generally, upwellings that form at the edges of
provinces are more buoyant relative to upwellings that form on
the tops of provinces. If enriched material envelops the core,
upwelling vigor is diminished so that plates are consumed more
quickly than they can fragment, and surface mobility is
eventually lost.",

abstract="All landforms on Titan that are unambiguously identifiable can be
explained by exogenic processes (aeolian, fluvial, impact
cratering, and mass wasting). Previous suggestions of
endogenically produced cryovolcanic constructs and flows have,
without exception, lacked conclusive diagnostic evidence. The
modification of sparse recognizable impact craters (themselves
exogenic) can be explained by aeolian and fluvial erosion.
Tectonic activity could be driven by global thermal evolution or
external forcing, rather than by active interior processes. A
lack of cryovolcanism would be consistent with geophysical
inferences of a relatively quiescent interior: incomplete
differentiation, only minor tidal heating, and possibly a lack of
internal convection today. Titan might be most akin to Callisto
with weather: an endogenically relatively inactive world with a
cool interior. We do not aim to disprove the existence of any and
all endogenic activity at Titan, nor to provide definitive
alternative hypotheses for all landforms, but instead to inject a
necessary level of caution into the discussion. The hypothesis of
Titan as a predominantly exogenic world can be tested through
additional Cassini observations and analyses of putative
cryovolcanic features, geophysical and thermal modeling of
Titan's interior evolution, modeling of icy satellite landscape
evolution that is shaped by exogenic processes alone, and
consideration of possible means for supplying Titan's atmospheric

important issue for understanding the internal evolution of the

the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere loaded by the
north polar cap, crustal heat-producing elements (HPE) abundances
based on martian geochemistry, and a temperature-dependent
thermal conductivity for the upper mantle. We also perform
similar calculations for the south polar region, although
uncertainties in lithospheric flexure make the results less

sublithospheric heat flows cannot be higher than 19 and 12 mW
m−2, respectively, in the north polar region, and similar values
might be representative of the south polar region (although with
a somewhat higher surface heat flow due to the radioactive
contribution from a thicker crust). These values, if
representative of martian averages, do not necessarily imply
sub-chondritic HPE bulk abundances for Mars (as previously
suggested), since (1) chondritic composition models produce a
present-day total heat power equivalent to an average surface
heat flow of 14--22 mW m−2 and (2) some convective models obtain
similar heat flows for the present time. Regions of low heat flow

a conductive shell must be cold if temperature gradients are to

ammonia-water pockets undergo partial freezing in the cold ice
shell, the ammonia concentration in the pockets increases,
decreasing the negative buoyancy of the ammonia--water mixture.
If the ice shell is contaminated by silicates delivered in
impacts, the liquid--solid density difference would be even less.
While the liquid cannot easily become buoyant relative to the
surrounding ice, these concentrated ammonia-water pockets are
sufficiently close to the neutral buoyancy point that large-scale
tectonic stress patterns (tides, non-synchronous rotation,
satellite volume changes, solid state convection, or subsurface
pressure gradients associated with topography) would enable the
ammonia to erupt effusively onto the surface. Rather than

large melt regions within a few tens of thousands of years.
Stronger, more localized concentrations result in melt-through in

scale for melt-through is shorter than the time scale for the
solid-state viscous inflow of ice by several orders of magnitude.
In general, modest concentrations of tidal heat can melt ice away
faster than viscous inflow, leading to melt-through. A mechanism
to transmit these heat concentrations through the ocean is
required for this model. Such heat transport could be the result
of convective plumes in the ocean driven by seafloor volcanism or

older than about 2.5 Ga. At modern zones of low-angle-, or
flat-subduction, magmatic additions to new crust come from
partial melting of both the subducting oceanic crust (slab) and
the thin wedge of mantle above the slab. Evidence for both a slab
and wedge source is preserved in most late Archaean (3.0--2.5 Ga)
terrains, but we find little evidence that a mantle wedge
contributed to crustal growth prior to ∼3.1 Ga. This lack of
evidence in part reflects a dearth of exposed crust aged between
3.0 and 3.3 Ga, but also suggests that subduction enriched mantle
source regions did not develop before ∼3.3 Ga and possibly not
before 3.1 Ga. In contrast to most modern terrains and some
late-Archaean terrains, early Archaean (>∼3.3 Ga) continental
crust evolved through direct melting of thick mafic crust. We
invoke a process of subduction that does not include the
development of a mantle wedge, and call this process Archaean
flat-subduction to distinguish it from modern low-angle

mass accretion rate into the Sun and viscous efficiency at the

formation of graphite and methane permits metastable existence of
hydrocarbons with respect to the inorganic gases H2, CO, and H2O.
Low temperatures, high pressures, high abundances of CO, low
abundances of H2O, low accretion rates, and low viscous
efficiencies favor stability of hydrocarbons. Condensed PAHs are
stable relative to nominal abundances of the inorganic gases at
temperatures below ∼450 K depending on the physical parameters
adopted for the nebula. Normal alkanes with carbon numbers <10

evolution of the nebula, hydrocarbons have a thermodynamic
potential to form in a narrow zone, which moved toward the Sun as
the accretion rate decreased. At radial distances of 2--4 AU,
hydrocarbons had a potential to form at the time when the
accretion rate was 10−6.3--10−7.7 solar mass yr−1, depending on
the viscous efficiency. High temperature, low pressure, and a
high CO/H2O ratio in the nebula increase the stability of PAHs

The sequence is used to test earlier results from orbit G1, based

progressive change in azimuthal orientation over about 90° in a
clockwise sense. Such a progression is consistent with expected
stress variations that would accompany plausible non-synchronous
rotation. The more recent data provide a more complete record

continual clockwise change of orientation would require at least
1000° (>5 cycles) of azimuthal rotation. If due to
non-synchronous rotation of Europa, this result implies that we
are seeing back further into the tectonic record than the G1
results had suggested. The three sets of orientations found by
Geissler et al. now appear to have been spaced out over several
cycles, not during a fraction of one cycle. While our more
complete sequence of lineament formation is consistent with
non-synchronous rotation, a statistical test shows that it cannot

locations are near the equator (10--30°S), namely Hotei Regio,
Tui Regio and Sotra Patera; in some cases changes in brightness
and/or in appearance were reported therein. We also investigate a
portion of the undifferentiated plains, areas relatively
homogeneous and dark in radar observations, located near
20--25°N. This is a follow-up on a previous paper in which we had
inferred surface albedos for some distinct regions of interest
(RoIs) identified within the Hotei, Tui and Sotra areas through a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and radiative transfer (RT)
modeling (Solomonidou [2014]. J. Geophys. Res. 119, 1729--1747).
We apply the same methods here to a larger dataset looking for
variations of the surface albedo with time and using the Huygens
landing site as the `ground truth' for calibration purposes. As
expected, the undifferentiated plains remain unchanged from
January 2010 to June 2012. Our analysis of Hotei Regio data from
March 2005 to March 2009 also does not show any significant
surface albedo variations within uncertainties. We note however
that our RT retrievals are not optimal in this case because of
the use of a plane-parallel code and the unfavorable geometry of
the associated datasets. Conversely, Tui Regio and Sotra Patera
show surface albedo fluctuations with time with pronounced trends
for darkening and for brightening respectively. The Tui Regio
spectrum exhibits a surface albedo decrease from March 2005 to
February 2009, at 0.94, 1.08, 2.03, and 5 $\mu$m wavelengths,
while the spectrum shape remains the same over that time. On the
contrary, the Sotra Patera area became at least two times
brighter within a year (April 2005--February 2006), at 1.58
$\mu$m, 2.03 $\mu$m, and 5 $\mu$m. We also retrieved surface
albedo spectra for three reference regions surrounding Hotei, Tui
and Sotra and for three additional regions we use as `test cases'
that correspond to dune fields. During the time periods explored
here we find that, as expected and contrary to Tui Regio and
Sotra Patera, the test cases did not show any significant changes
in surface albedo. We therefore suggest that temporal variations
of surface albedo exist for some areas on Titan, but that their
origin may differ from one region to the other. They could be due
to diverse, past and/or ongoing formation processes (endogenic

general lower than the equivalent radioactive heat production of
Mars at the corresponding times, suggesting a limited
contribution from secular cooling to the heat flow during the
majority of the history of Mars. This is contrary to the

particular Titan, Saturn's largest moon, possesses a complex and
dynamic geology as witnessed by its varied surface morphology
resulting from aeolian, fluvial, and possibly tectonic and
endogenous cryovolcanic processes. The Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SAR) instrument on board Cassini spacecraft, indicates the
possibility for morphotectonic features on Titan's surface such
as mountains, ridges, faults and canyons. The mechanisms that
formed these morphotectonic structures are still unclear since
ensuing processes, such as erosion may have modified or partially
obscured them. Due to the limitations of Cassini--Huygens in the
acquisition of in situ measurements or samples relevant to
geotectonics processes and the lack of high spatial resolution
imaging, we do not have precise enough data of the morphology and
topography of Titan. However we suggest that contractional
tectonism followed by atmospheric modifications has resulted in
the observed morphotectonic features. To test the possibility of
morphotectonics on Titan, we provide in this work a comparative
study between Cassini observations of the satellite versus
terrestrial tectonic systems and infer suggestions for possible
formation mechanisms.",

title="Differentiation of Vesta: Implications for a shallow magma ocean",
author="Neumann, Wladimir and Breuer, Doris and Spohn, Tilman",
abstract="Abstract The Dawn mission confirms earlier predictions that the
asteroid 4 Vesta is differentiated with an iron-rich core, a
silicate mantle and a basaltic crust, and supports the conjecture
of Vesta being the parent body of the HED meteorites. To better
understand its early evolution, we perform numerical calculations
of the thermo-chemical evolution adopting new data obtained by
the Dawn mission such as mass, bulk density and size of the
asteroid. We have expanded the thermo-chemical evolution model of
Neumann et al. (2012) that includes accretion, compaction,
melting and the associated changes of the material properties and
the partitioning of incompatible elements such as the radioactive
heat sources, advective heat transport, and differentiation by
porous flow, to further consider convection and the associated
effective cooling in a potential magma ocean. Depending on the
melt fraction, the heat transport by melt segregation is modelled
either by assuming melt flow in a porous medium or by simulating
vigorous convection and heat flux of a magma ocean with a high
effective thermal conductivity. Our results show that
partitioning of 26Al and its transport with the silicate melt is
crucial for the formation of a global and deep magma ocean. Due
to the enrichment of 26Al in the liquid phase and its
accumulation in the sub-surface (for formation times t 0 < 1.5 Ma
), a thin shallow magma ocean with a thickness of 1 to a few tens
of km forms -- its thickness depends on the viscosity of silicate
melt. The lifetime of the shallow magma ocean is O ( 10 4 ) -- O
( 10 6 ) years and convection in this layer is accompanied by the
extrusion of 26Al at the surface, resulting in the formation of a
basaltic crust. The interior differentiates from the outside
inwards with a mantle that is depleted in 26Al and core formation
is completed within ∼ 0.3 Ma . The lower mantle experiences a
maximal melt fraction of 45\% suggesting a harzburgitic to
dunitic composition. Our results support the formation of
non-cumulate eucrites by the extrusion of early partial melt
while cumulate eucrites and diogenites may form from the
crystallising shallow magma ocean. Silicate melt is present in
the mantle for up to 150 Ma, and convection in a crystallising
core proceeds for approximately 100 Ma, supporting the idea of an
early magnetic field to explain the remnant magnetisation
observed in some HED meteorites.",

of extension that probably contributed to this regional lowering.
Several locations on Xanadu's western and southern margins

planet?",

Stracke, B and Breuer, D and Rauer, H",
abstract="Abstract Motivation: The most likely places for finding life
outside the Solar System are rocky planets, some of which may
have surface conditions allowing for liquid water, one of the
major prerequisites for life. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon
dioxide (CO2), play an important role for the surface
temperature and, thus, the habitability of an extrasolar planet.
The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is in part
determined by their outgassing from the interior. Method: We use
a two-dimensional convection model to calculate partial melting
and the amount of CO2 outgassed for Earth-sized stagnant-lid
planets. By varying the planetary mass, we investigate the
evolution of a secondary atmosphere dependent on the interior
structure (different ratio of planetary to core radius). We
further study the likelihood for plate tectonics depending on
the interior structure and investigate the influence of plate
tectonics on outgassing. Results: We find that for stagnant-lid
planets the relative size of the iron core has a large impact on
the production of partial melt because a variation in the
interior structure changes the pressure gradient and thereby the
melting temperature of silicate rocks with depth. As a
consequence, for planets with a large core (a radius of at least
70--75\% of the planet′s radius), outgassing from the interior
is strongly reduced in comparison to a planet with the same
radius but a small core. This finding suggests that the outer
edge of the habitable zone of a star not only depends on the
distance from the star and thus the solar influx but also is
further limited by small outgassing for stagnant-lid planets
with a high average density, indicating a high iron content
(e.g. Mercury and the recently detected exoplanets Kepler-10b
and CoRoT-7b). This contradicts previous models that have
assumed CO2 reservoirs being in principle unlimited for all
planets. If plate tectonics is initiated, several tens of bars
of CO2 can be outgassed in a short period of time -- even for
planets with a large iron core -- and the outer boundary of the
habitable zone is not influenced by the interior structure. It
is, however, more difficult for planets with a thin mantle (in
our test case, with a thickness of 10\% of the planet′s radius)
to initiate plate tectonics. Our results indicate that the
interior structure may strongly influence the amount of CO2 in
planetary atmospheres and, thereby, the habitability of rocky
planets. To obtain better constraints on the interior structure
accurate measurements of size and mass are necessary.",

Regio reveal a rich collection of geological features that
correlate between the two sets of images. The degree of
correlation is greater than anywhere else seen on Titan. Central
to Hotei Regio is a basin filled with cryovolcanic flows that
are anomalously bright in VIMS data (in particular at 5 $\mu$m)
and quite variable in roughness in SAR. The edges of the flows
are dark in SAR data and appear to overrun a VIMS-bright
substrate. SAR-stereo topography shows the flows to be viscous,
100--200 m thick. On its southern edge the basin is ringed by
higher (∼1 km) mountainous terrain. The mountains show mixed
texture in SAR data: some regions are extremely rough, exhibit
low and spectrally neutral albedo in VIMS data and may be partly
coated with darker hydrocarbons. Around the southern margin of
Hotei Regio, the SAR image shows several large, dendritic,
radar-bright channels that flow down from the mountainous
terrain and terminate in dark blue patches, seen in VIMS images,
whose infrared color is consistent with enrichment in water ice.
The patches are in depressions that we interpret to be filled
with fluvial deposits eroded and transported by liquid methane
in the channels. In the VIMS images the dark blue patches are
encased in a latticework of lighter bands that we suggest to
demark a set of circumferential and radial fault systems
bounding structural depressions. Conceivably the circular
features are tectonic structures that are remnant from an
ancient impact structure. We suggest that impact-generated
structures may have simply served as zones of weakness; no
direct causal connection, such as impact-induced volcanism, is
implied. We also speculate that two large dark features lying on
the northern margin of Hotei Regio could be calderas. In summary
the preservation of such a broad suite of VIMS infrared color
variations and the detailed correlation with features in the SAR
image and SAR topography evidence a complex set of geological
processes (pluvial, fluvial, tectonic, cryovolcanic, impact)
that have likely remained active up to very recent geological
time (<104 year). That the cryovolcanic flows are excessively
bright in the infrared, particularly at 5 $\mu$m, might signal
ongoing geological activity. One study [Nelson, R.M., and 28
colleagues, 2009. Icarus 199, 429--441] reported significant
2-$\mu$m albedo changes in VIMS data for Hotei Arcus acquired
between 2004 and 2006, that were interpreted as evidence for
such activity. However in our review of that work, we do not
agree that such evidence has yet been found.",

resolutions and with different illumination geometries. Using
these datasets we have mapped and identified the different

elevation models (DEMs) of the topography within most of the
Castalia Macula region. Using these data sets in combination
allows us to map the geology and topography of this area in
greater detail than perhaps any other site on Europa. Castalia
Macula consists of unusually dark and reddish material, most of
which is confined to a broad topographic depression 350 m deep
located between two large uplifted domes 900 and 750 m high, to
the north and south, respectively. The preservation of topography
at the bottom of Castalia Macula indicates that dark material
initially filled the depression to a certain depth but was
subsequently removed via drainage, resulting in a dark stain up
to the original equipotential surface. Superposition and
topographic relationships suggest that the Castalia Macula plains
deposit formed prior to uplift of both domes, and at least two
distinct episodes of chaos formation have occurred near and on
top of the northern dome. It appears that Castalia Macula is
comparatively young and was active relatively recently, therefore
it could provide an ideal place to sample material that has
recently been erupted from the subsurface, and may have been in
communication with Europa's ocean. These factors combine to make
Castalia Macula a very attractive site for a future Europa

title="The role of boundary conditions in numerical models of subduction
zone dynamics",
author="Quinquis, Matthieu E T and Buiter, Susanne J H and Ellis, Susan",
abstract="Numerical studies of subduction zone dynamics on a regional scale
usually use a limited spatial extent for their models and
therefore need to define boundary conditions on all model edges.
These boundary conditions imply a choice for the mechanical and
thermal state of the surrounding regions which may influence the
evolution of the model system. We investigate the role of the
surface and lateral boundary conditions for simple mechanical
subduction models using a standard finite element method. We find
that subduction is only possible if the slab can decouple from
the surface. This decoupling can be achieved by a true free
surface, a free-slip surface with a weak crust for the subducting
plate, or a free-slip surface with a layer of low viscosity, low
density material (`sticky air') between the model surface and the
crust. Models of slab dynamics that employ a free-slip surface
reproduce trench migration, slab sinking velocities and slab
geometry of models with a free surface, as long as they use
either a weak crust, which can be viscous, viscoelastic and/or
brittle, or a `sticky air' layer. The vertical topography will
however not be reproduced for free-slip models without a `sticky
air' layer. For ocean--ocean convergent models we find that the
application of inflow boundary conditions at the edges of the
subducting or overriding lithosphere controls trench motion and
the geometry of the subducting slab. Inflow on the overriding
side causes trench retreat and a slab resting on the lower
mantle, whereas inflow restricted to the subducting side can
cause trench advance and a slab which folds on the lower mantle.",

models of free subduction",
author="Stegman, D R and Farrington, R and Capitanio, F A and Schellart,

abstract="Previous models of subduction (both analogue and numerical) have
observed a number of distinct styles of subduction, each with
particular subduction motions (partitioned between slab rollback
and forward plate advance) and associated slab morphologies. We
use 3-D numerical models to investigate subduction dynamics by
varying the strength of slabs as well as the buoyancy, and
propose a new classification based on these parameters. The slab
strength is specified both through the ratio of viscosities
between the subducting plate and upper mantle
($\eta$plate/$\eta$um) as well as the plate thickness, hplate.
Only a very restrictive range of plates (``strong'' plates with
smaller buoyancy) tend to favor modes of subduction which are
exclusively advancing. Plates which have greater negative
buoyancy will eventually transition into a retreating style. We
find that the flexural strength and the buoyancy determine the
subduction style (as distinguished by a characteristic slab
morphology), and control several subduction characteristics
including the partitioning between slab rollback and plate
advance, the trench curvature, and the slab's radius of
curvature. Plates that are 80--100 km thick with
$\eta$plate/$\eta$um ~ 100--300 are classified here as ``weak''
and are the only plates to exhibit slab geometry with several
recumbent folds atop the more viscous lower mantle. This regime
of weak plates with their associated slab morphologies
(predominant folding) is argued to be most similar to slabs on
Earth based on the presence of folded slab piles in Earth's
upper mantle (as interpreted from seismic tomography).",

abstract="Since Titan entered Northern spring in August 2009, the North
Pole has been illuminated allowing observations at optical
wavelengths. On June 5, 2010 the Visual and Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft observed the
Northern Pole area with a pixel size from 3 to 7 km. Since, as we
demonstrate, little of the solar flux at 5 $\mu$m is scattered by
the atmosphere, these observations were obtained at relatively
large incidence angles and allowed us to build a mosaic covering
an area of more than 500,000 km2 that overlaps and complements
observations made by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in 2007.
We find that there is an excellent correlation between the shape
of the radar dark area, known as Ligeia Mare and the VIMS
5-$\mu$m dark unit. Matching most of the radar shoreline, the
2010 VIMS observations suggest that the 125,000-km2 surface area
of Ligeia Mare measured by RADAR in 2007 has not significantly
changed. The VIMS observations complement the radar observations
to the west of Ligeia Mare and suggest that Ligeia Mare is
connected to Kraken Mare by either a diffuse network similar to a
swamp area, or by well-defined, sub-pixel rivers. Considering the
results of recent evaporation models of methane, our preferred
interpretation of the relative constancy in surface area of
Ligeia is that it is principally composed of ethane although we
cannot rule out the possibility that methane evaporation is
balanced with replenishment by either precipitation or
underground seepage. There is also strong correlation between the
location of the small radar lakes and the small VIMS 5-$\mu$m
dark patches. The geographic location of the small lakes are
within a VIMS pixel of the SAR location, suggesting that the
non-synchronous component of Titan's spin rate, if it exists, was
less than 2.3 $\times$ 10−4 deg/day between 2007 and 2010 in
agreement with the recent T64 radar observations. These
observations question the existence of non-synchronous rotation.
Two radar-bright features appear dark at 5-$\mu$m. The simplest
interpretation is that these are very shallow lakes, less than
one meter deep. Three new small lakes, named Freeman, Cardiel,
and Towada by the IAU, are found outside of the area mapped with
the SAR. A single-scattering model describing reflection of
sunlight at 5-$\mu$m suggests that the lake surface is
mirror-like and that the albedo of the solid surfaces surrounding
the lakes is about 8\%. These observations together with
information of the haze aerosols allow us to show that Titan's
lakes, atmospheric ethane and aerosol haze are smaller carbon
reservoirs than Titan's sand dunes and atmospheric methane. A
simple model involving an outburst of methane a few hundreds of
Myr ago followed by the dissociation of methane in the atmosphere
leading to the formation of the haze particles that constitute
the dune fields would be consistent with both the present
observations and recent measurements of isotopic ratios in
atmospheric methane (Mandt, K.E. et al. [2012]. Astrophys. J.

Revealed by 1998 {HST} Imaging",

abstract="On 11--12 August 1998, we imaged Neptune using the Hubble Space
Telescope WFPC2 CCD camera and NICMOS InSb camera to obtain
high-spatial-resolution, absolutely calibrated imagery from the
visible through the near infrared. We used nine HST orbits to
intensively sample one rotation of Neptune, and four additional
orbits to sample cloud evolution and motions one and two
rotations later. In 1998 Neptune displayed more bright cloud
features at southern mid-latitudes (mainly at 30°S and 45°S) than
in 1996, producing small, but significant, increases in Neptune's
disk-integrated albedo of 1.4$\pm$1, 1.9$\pm$1, and 9.5$\pm$1\%
for F467M, F673N, and F850LP filters respectively. Averages over
longitude regions relatively free of discrete bright clouds did
not show substantial brightness changes for most filters.
Although we were unable to directly confirm the continued
presence in 1998 of the 1996 Northern Great Dark Spot NGDS-32, we
did find what we believe to be its bright northern companion
cloud at 39°N. The increased extent of both northern and southern
companions in 1998 may have obscured the normally dark core of
this circulation feature. The 1996 Great Dark Spot NGDS-15 was
not visible in 1998. The 1996 dark circumpolar band near
60°--70°S was present in 1998, with somewhat enhanced contrast.
Significant evolution of cloud features was found over short time
intervals of one and two rotations of Neptune, especially at
31°S, 45°S, and 70°S. Cloud motions in 1998 agree relatively well
with the 1989 Voyager smoothed profile of L. A. Sromovsky et al.

bright companion clouds, and with small but significant
deviations that are consistent with those observed in 1995 and
1996 (Sromovsky et al. 2001, Icarus149, 459--488). These wind
profile deviations contribute important modifications to the
potential vorticity gradients that control latitudinal drift
rates of GDS-scale vortices on Neptune (according to numerical
simulations of R. P. LeBeau and T. E. Dowling (1998, Icarus132,
239--265)). However, these modifications alone do not explain the

abstract="Although it is mostly accepted that the lower part of the ice
shell of Europa is actively convective, there is still much
uncertainty about the flow mechanism dominating the rheology of
this convective layer, which largely depends on the grain size of
the ice. In this work, we examined thermal equilibrium states in
a tidally heated and strained convective shell, for two
rheologies sensitive to grain size, grain boundary sliding and
diffusion creep. If we take a lower limit of 70 mW m−2 for the
surface heat flow, according to some geological features
observed, the ice grain size should be less than 2 or 0.2 mm for
grain boundary sliding or diffusion creep respectively. If in
addition the thickness of the ice shell is constrained to a few
tens of kilometers and it is assumed that the thickness of the
convective layer is related to lenticulae spacing, then grain
sizes between 0.2 and 2 mm for grain boundary sliding, and
between 0.1 and 0.2 mm for diffusion creep are obtained. Also,
local convective layer thicknesses deduced from lenticulae

sliding. Our results thus favor grain boundary sliding as the
dominant rheology for the water ice in Europa's convective layer,

determining the finite pole of rotation between two rigid plates

region surrounding a prominent dark spot on Europa, Castalia
Macula. This region is located near the equator of Europa's
trailing hemisphere and has been suggested as a site where
crustal convergence may have occurred. Previous reconstructions
of the region have indicated that a ridge set and/or a band-like

accommodated surface contraction. However, a critical examination
of the differences between these reconstructions has been
complicated by the lack of a finite pole of rotation for the
plates involved in either reconstruction. We have applied our
modeling technique, coupled with a detailed examination of the
morphology and cross-cutting relationships involving this ridge
set and band-like complex, to determine if a unique
reconstruction exists for several tectonic plates in this region.
The cross-cutting relationships involving the ridge set also
allow us to test the general assumption that plates behave
rigidly on Europa. Assuming rigid behavior, our results suggest
that a unique reconstruction does exist, indicating the ridge set
accommodated surface contraction. However, analysis performed to
test the assumption of plate rigidity indicates that one or more
of the plates in the region did not behave rigidly. This does not
rule out surface contraction along the ridge set but does

of Jupiter's satellite, Europa",
author="Prieto-Ballesteros, Olga and Kargel, Jeffrey S",
abstract="The complex geology of Europa is evidenced by many tectonic and
cryomagmatic resurfacing structures, some of which are
``painted'' into a more visible expression by exogenic alteration
processes acting on the principal endogenic cryopetrology. The
surface materials emplaced and affected by this activity are
mainly composed of water ice in some areas, but in other places
there are other minerals involved. Non-ice minerals are visually
recognized by their low albedo and reddish color either when
first emplaced or, more likely, after alteration by Europan
weathering processes, especially sublimation and alteration by
ionizing radiation. While red chromophoric material could be due
to endogenic production of solid sulfur allotropes or other
compounds, most likely the red substance is an impurity produced
by radiation alteration of hydrated sulfate salts or sulphuric
acid of mainly internal origin. If the non-ice red materials or
their precursors have a source in the satellite interior, and if
they are not merely trace contaminants, then they can play an
important role in the evolution of the icy crust, including
structural differentiation and the internal dynamics. Here we
assume that these substances are major components of Europa's
cryo/hydrosphere, as some models have predicted they should be.
If this is an accurate assumption, then these substances should
not be neglected in physical, chemical, and biological models of
Europa, even if major uncertainties remain as to the exact
identity, abundance, and distribution of the non-ice materials.
The physical chemical properties of the ice-associated materials
will contribute to the physical state of the crust today and in
the geological past. In order to model the influence of them on
the thermal state and the geology, we have determined the thermal
properties of the hydrated salts. Our new lab data reveal very
low thermal conductivities for hydrated salts compared to water
ice. Lower conductivities of salty ice would produce steeper
thermal gradients than in pure ice. If there are salt-rich layers
inside the crust, forming salt beds over the seafloor or a briny
eutectic crust, for instance, the high thermal gradients may
promote endogenic geological activity. On the seafloor, bedded
salt accumulations may exhibit high thermochemical gradients.
Metamorphic and magmatic processes and possible niches for
thermophilic life at shallow suboceanic depths result from the
calculated thermal profiles, even if the ocean is very cold.",

revealed a low-altitude layer in the jovian ionosphere (Hinson et
al. 1998, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 9505--9520). The peak electron
density of the layer measured on egress, which was at 93° solar
zenith angle near the morning terminator, was inferred to be of
the order of 104 cm−3. A substantial low-altitude layer of
hydrocarbon ions in the jovian ionosphere was predicted by Kim
and Fox (1994), but the peak total ion density at predawn was
about 102 cm−3, two orders of magnitude smaller than the noon
values, due to the efficient recombination of molecular ions
during the night. The existence of large electron densities in
the jovian ionospheric E region at predawn suggests the presence
of ions with long lifetimes and/or those produced by a source
that exhibits little local time dependence, such as ions
originating from meteoroid ablation in Jupiter's atmosphere. We
have modeled the production rates and subsequent chemistry of
seven meteoric ions, including O+, C+, Si+, Fe+, Mg+, Na+, and
S+, their compounds with H, H2, and hydrocarbons, and the
corresponding neutral species. The models predict a layer of
meteoric ions in the altitude region of 350--450 km above the
1-bar level, with peak total ion densities of several times 104
cm−3, which are comparable to the observed values. The peak of
the meteoric atomic ion layer is most apparent at predawn and is
located higher than that of the hydrocarbon ion layer during the
daytime and higher than the altitude of peak production of ions
by meteor ablation. At the altitude of peak ablation, about 350
km, meteoric ions are mainly removed by reactions with
hydrocarbons in either two-body or three-body reactions, and the
molecular ions produced are neutralized efficiently by
dissociative recombination. Meteoric ions may also form adduct
ions by termolecular reactions with hydrogen molecules, but
metallic ions, such as Na+, Mg+, and Fe+, may be reformed from
the adduct ions by a series of reactions with H atoms. Thus the
net ion loss process at the metal ion peak may be dominated by
rediative recombination, and the meteoric ion density profiles
show little diurnal variation. The predicted peak electron
density and altitude and the relative densities of the ions are
dependent on the rate coefficients assumed for many of the
reactions involved, and measurements of key rate coefficients are
needed to further constrain the models.",

author="Ivanov, M A and Prockter, L M and Dalton, B",
abstract="Three major features make Europa a unique scientific target for
a lander-oriented interplanetary mission: (1) the knowledge of
the composition of the surface of Europa is limited to
interpretations of the spectral data, (2) a lander could provide
unique new information about outer parts of the solar system,
and (3) Europa may have a subsurface ocean that potentially may
harbor life, the traces of which may occur on the surface and
could be sampled directly by a lander. These characteristics of
Europa bring the requirement of safe landing to the highest
priority level because any successful landing on the surface of
this moon will yield scientific results of fundamental
importance. The safety requirements include four major
components. (1) A landing site should preferentially be on the
anti-Jovian hemisphere of Europa in order to facilitate the
orbital maneuvers of the spacecraft. (2) A landing site should
be on the leading hemisphere of Europa in order to extend the
lifetime of a lander and sample pristine material of the planet.
(3) Images with the highest possible resolution must be
available for the selection of landing sites. (4) The terrain
for landing must have morphology (relief) that minimizes the
risk of landing and represents a target that is important from a
scientific point of view. These components severely restrict the
selection of regions for landing on the surface of Europa. After
the photogeologic analysis of all Galileo images with a
resolution of better than about 70 m/pixel taken for the leading
hemisphere of Europa, we propose one primary and two secondary
(backup) landing sites. The primary site (51.8°S, 177.2°W) is
within a pull-apart zone affected by a small chaos. The first
backup site (68.1°S, 196.7°W) is also inside of a pull-apart
zone and is covered by images of the lower resolution (51.4
m/pixel). The second backup site (2.4°N, 181.1°W) is imaged by
relatively low-resolution images (∼70 m/pixel) and corresponds
to a cluster of small patches of dark and probably smooth plains
that may represent landing targets of the highest scientific
priority from the scientific point of view. The lack of the
high-resolution images for this region prevents, however, its
selection as the primary landing target.",

in order to assess the geologic history of this region using
modern data sets such as MOLA topography and the high-resolution
images provided by the HRSC, CTX, and HiRISE cameras. Results of
our mapping show that the geologic history of Isidis Planitia
consists of three principal episodes. (1) Impact dominated
episode (Noachian, until ∼3.8 Ga): During this time, the oldest
materials in the study area were formed mostly by impact
reworking and mass-wasting. Other processes (e.g., volcanism and
fluvial/glacial activity) likely operated at this time but
played a subordinate role. (2) An episode related to volcanic
and fluvial/glacial activities (late Noachian--early Amazonian,
∼3.8--2.8 Ga): Volcanism appears as the most important process
at the beginning of this episode (∼3.8--3.5 Ga) and was
responsible for the formation of a large circum-Isidis volcanic
province by the early Hesperian epoch. Volcanic materials
covered large portions of the Isidis rim, almost completely
buried the previous crater record on the floor of the Isidis
basin, and probably were the major contributors to the filling
of the basin. Fluvial/glacial processes prevailed closer to the
end of the episode (early Hesperian--early Amazonian, ∼3.5--2.8
Ga) and were responsible for widespread resurfacing in the
Isidis Planitia region, mostly at ∼3.1--3.4 Ga. Glaciers and/or
ice sheets probably resulted in a massive glaciation of the rim
and the floor of the Isidis basin. The total volume of material
eroded from the Isidis rim by glacial and fluvial activity is
estimated to be about 35,000--50,000 km3, which is equivalent to
a composite layer about 40--60 m thick on entire floor of the
basin. More important, however, is that the eroded materials
were likely saturated with ice/water and could form wet deposits
on the floor. (3) Wind-dominated episode (since early Amazonian,
∼2.8 Ga): Wind activity dominated the later geologic history of
Isidis Planitia but resulted only in minor modification of the

abstract="We present maps of jovian cloud properties derived from images
taken simultaneously by the Galileo solid state imaging system
(SSI) and the near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS) at 26
visible and near-infrared wavelengths, ranging from 0.41 to
5.2$\mu$m. Three regions---the Great Red Spot (GRS), a 5-micron
Hot Spot, and one of the White Ovals---were studied. We perform a
principal component analysis (PCA) on the multispectral images.
The principal components (PCs), also known as empirical
orthogonal functions, depend only on wavelength. The first PC is
that spectral function which, when multiplied by an optimally
chosen number (amplitude factor) at each pixel location and
subtracted from the spectrum there, minimizes the variance for
the image as a whole. Succeeding PCs minimize the residual
variance after the earlier PCs have been subtracted off. We find
that the pixel-to-pixel variations at the different wavelengths
are highly correlated, such that the first three PCs explain 91\%
of the variance in the spectra. Further, one can estimate the
amplitudes of the first two PCs using only the four SSI
wavelengths and still explain 62\% of the variance of the entire
spectrum. This can be an advantage when trying to classify
features that are resolved in the SSI images but not in the NIMS
images. The first PC in all three regions shows negative
correlation between 5$\mu$m emission and reflected solar light in
both atmospheric windows and the methane and ammonia absorption
bands. Thus most of the bright, optically thick clouds blocking
thermal emission are also extended vertically to the upper
troposphere. The first PC at the GRS shows a negative correlation
between the violet and all other bands except 5$\mu$m for which
the correlation is positive. Thus in the GRS there is a red
chromophore (absorbing in the violet, reflecting at longer
wavelengths) which is associated with clouds that block 5-$\mu$m
emission. There is no such correlation at the hot spot and white
oval regions and therefore no chromophore associated with clouds.
The second PC shows a positive correlation between the depth of
the methane and ammonia absorption bands and brightness at other
visible and near-IR wavelengths; there is also a negative
correlation between these quantities and 5-$\mu$m emission. Thus
some of the bright, optically thick clouds blocking thermal
emission are deep and do not extend vertically to the upper
troposphere. A color image composed using the first three PCs
shows areas of unusual spectra, which appear in distinct colors.
An example is the small convective stormlike cloud to the
northwest of the GRS. This cloud is highly reflective at long
wavelengths (4$\mu$m) and might indicate unusually large
particles.",

chemical evolution in an attempt to explain the presence of ice
and hydrated materials on its surface and to understand the
physical and chemical nature of any ocean that may lie below. We
postulate that, following formation of the jovian system, the
europan evolutionary sequence has as its major links: (a) initial
carbonaceous chondrite rock, (b) global primordial aqueous
differentiation and formation of an impure primordial hydrous
crust, (c) brine evolution and intracrustal differentiation, (d)
degassing of Europa's mantle and gas venting, (e) hydrothermal

developed in the context of constraints provided by Galileo
imaging, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and gravity and
magnetometer data. Low-temperature aqueous differentiation from a
carbonaceous CI or CM chondrite precursor, without further
chemical processing, would result in a crust/ocean enriched in
magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate, consistent with Galileo
spectroscopy. Within the bounds of this simple model, a wide
range of possible layered structures may result; the final state
depends on the details of intracrustal differentiation.
Devolatilization of the rocky mantle and hydrothermal brine
reactions could have produced very different ocean/crust
compositions, e.g., an ocean/crust of sodium carbonate or
sulfuric acid, or a crust containing abundant clathrate hydrates.
Realistic chemical--physical evolution scenarios differ greatly
in detailed predictions, but they generally call for a highly
impure and chemically layered crust. Some of these models could
lead also to lateral chemical heterogeneities by diapiric
upwellings and/or cryovolcanism. We describe some plausible
geological consequences of the physical--chemical structures

shallow subsurface and thus may detect warmth from lava flows for
longer than surface infrared emission. However, satellite
microwave instruments typically have low spatial resolution (10s
of km) so volcanic heat is diluted in the wide instrument
footprint. We examine the prospects for the detection of volcanic
deposits by microwave, given likely planetary eruption rates and
lava flow deposit geometries, using Mt Etna as a template.

title="Formation of mountains on Io: Variable volcanism and thermal
stresses",
author="Kirchoff, Michelle R and McKinnon, William B",
abstract="Thermal stresses are potentially important drivers of Io's
tectonics and mountain building. It has been hypothesized that
sustained local or regional shut down of heat-pipe volcanism on
Io could lead to deep crustal heating and large compressive
stresses [McKinnon, W.B., Schenk, P.M., Dombard, A.J., 2001.
Geology 29, 103--106]. Such large stresses would then be
relieved by thrust faulting and uplifting of crustal blocks,
producing mountains like those observed on Io. Here we analyze
the tectonic consequences of the heat-pipe model in detail,
considering both the initial thermal stress state of a basalt or
peridotite crust created by heat-pipe volcanism, and relative
roles of subsidence stresses (due to burial of preexisting
layers) and thermal stresses arising from variable volcanism and
changes in crustal (∼lithosphere) thickness. We limit the
magnitude of the potential subsidence stresses in our study,
because the magnitude of subsidence stresses can be quite large,
if not dominant. Results indicate that for a fixed crustal
thickness, the region of failure and faulting moves closer to
the surface as eruption rate decreases and time increases. When
the crust melts at its base as volcanism decreases (as might
occur under steady state tidal heating), resulting in crustal
thinning, the region of failure is brought even closer to the
surface. Naturally, when compressive, subsidence stresses are
included, the vertical extent of crust in brittle failure
thickens to include most of the lithosphere. In contrast,
increases in eruption rate cause the extent of the region in
compressional failure to decrease and be driven very deep in the
crust (in the absence of sufficient subsidence stress).
Therefore, regions of declining volcanism are more likely to
produce mountains, whereas regions of extensive or increasing
volcanism are less likely to do so. This is consistent with the
observation of a global anticorrelation between mountains and
volcanic centers on Io. Finally, we find that the choice of
crustal composition/rheology (dry basalt vs. dry peridotite) has
little effect on our results implying that basalt, peridotite
and komatiite are all similarly ``stiff'' in the Io environment.",

extensive ambient mantle melting had the highest Mg-numbers,
lowest FeO contents, and lowest densities at ~ 2.5--3.5 Ga.
These results are in good agreement with Re--Os ages of
kimberlite-hosted cratonic mantle xenoliths and enclosed
sulfides, and provide support for the hypothesis of Jordan that
low densities of cratonic mantle are a measure of their high
preservation potential. Cratonization of the Earth reached its
zenith at ~ 2.5--3.5 Ga when ambient mantle was hot and
extensive melting produced oceanic crust 30--45 km thick.
However, there is a mass imbalance exhibited by the craton-wide
distribution of harzburgite residues and the paucity of their
complementary magmas that had compositions like the non-arc
basalts. We suggest that the problem of the missing basaltic
oceanic crust can be resolved by its hydration, cooling and
partial transformation to eclogite, which caused foundering of
the entire lithosphere. Some of the oceanic crust partially
melted during foundering to produce continental crust composed
of tonalite--trondhjemite--granodiorite (TTG). The remaining
lithosphere gravitationally separated into 1) residual eclogite
that continued its descent, and 2) buoyant harzburgite diapirs
that rose to underplate cratonic nuclei composed of non-arc
basalts and TTG. Finally, assembly of cratonic nuclei into
cratons at convergent boundaries substantially modified
harzburgite residues by melt-rock reaction.",

abstract="Extreme volcanism on Io results from tidal heating, but its
tidal dissipation mechanisms and magma ascent processes are
poorly constrained. Here we analyze the distribution of volcanic
hotspots and paterae identified within the first
1:15,000,000-scale global geologic map of Io to characterize
their patterns of spatial organization. Ionian hotspots
correspond to the locations of positive thermal anomalies that
have been detected since 1979, whereas paterae are caldera-like
volcano-tectonic depressions that record locations of volcanic
activity over a longer period of geologic time (up to ∼1 million
years). Some (∼20\%) of patera floor units are associated with
active hotspots, but the majority appeared to be extinct or
dormant at the time of observation. Volcano distributions are
useful for testing interior models of Io because the relative
strength of tidal heating in the asthenosphere and deep-mantle
greatly affect expected patterns of surface heat flux. We
examine the spatial distribution of volcanic centers using
nearest neighbor (NN) statistics and distance-based clustering.
Nearest neighbor analysis reveals that hotspots (i.e., sites of
active volcanism) are globally random, but closer to the
equator, they are uniform (i.e., more widely spaced than a
random model would predict). This suggests that magma scavenging
around active volcanic systems in the near-equatorial region may
drive hotspots apart, whereas vigorous mantle convection and/or
deep-mantle heating may reduce surface heat flux variations and
promote spatial randomness on a global scale. In contrast to the
hotspots, NN patera floor units tend to be clustered, which
implies that multiple eruptive units tend to form in association
with most volcanic systems. Generalized paterae, which represent
volcanic systems, tend to be uniformly distributed, except in
the northern regions, where their distribution is random. This
implies that most volcanic systems interact with one another and
repel, except at high northern latitudes, where they appear to
form independently. Distance-based clustering results support a
dominant role for asthenospheric heating within Io, but show a
30--60° eastward offset in volcano concentrations from predicted
locations of maximum surface heat flux along the tidal axis.
This offset may imply faster than synchronous rotation, a role
for lateral advection of magma within Io's interior prior to its
eruption, state of stress controls on the locations of magma
ascent, and/or a missing component in existing tidal dissipation
models, such as the effects of fluid tides generated within a

author="Grott, M and Breuer, D",
abstract="The martian elastic lithosphere thickness T e has recently been
constrained by modeling the geodynamical response to loading at
the martian polar caps and T e was found to exceed 300 km at the
north pole today. Geological evidence suggests that Mars has
been volcanically active in the recent past and we have
reinvestigated the martian thermal evolution, identifying models
which are consistent with T e > 300 km and the observed recent
magmatic activity. We find that although models satisfying both
constraints can be constructed, special assumptions regarding
the concentration and distribution of radioactive elements, the
style of mantle convection and/or the mantle's volatile content
need to be made. If a dry mantle rheology is assumed, strong
plumes caused by, e.g., a strongly pressure dependent mantle
viscosity or endothermic phase transitions near the core--mantle
boundary are required to allow for decompression melting in the
heads of mantle plumes. For a wet mantle, large mantle water
contents of the order of 1000 ppm are required to allow for
partial mantle melting. Also, for a moderate crustal enrichment
of heat producing, elements the planet's bulk composition needs
to be 25 and 50\% sub-chondritic for dry and wet mantle
rheologies, respectively. Even then, models resulting in a
globally averaged elastic thicknesses of T e > 300 km are
difficult to reconcile with most elastic thickness estimates
available for the Hesperian and Amazonian periods. It therefore
seems likely that large elastic thicknesses in excess of 300 km
are not representative for the bulk of the planet and that T e
possibly shows a large degree of spatial heterogeneity.",

heat transfer by volcanic eruptions means that Io's geothermal
gradient well away from volcanic centres is very small, of order
1 K km−1. This result is independent of any reasonable
assumptions about the radiogenic heating rate in the
lithosphere. The lithosphere temperature does not increase
greatly above the surface temperature until the base of the
lithosphere is approached, except in limited areas around
shallow magma bodies. As a consequence, solid volatile sulphur
compounds mobilized by volcanic processes and re-deposited on
the surface of Io commonly remain solid until they reach great
depths as they are progressively buried by ongoing activity. For
current estimates of the volcanic heat transfer rate, melting of
SO2 does not begin until a depth of ∼20 km and sulphur remains
solid to a depth of ∼26 km in a 30 km thick lithosphere. Rising
magmas can incorporate fluids from these deep sulphur compound

abstract="Abstract We have mapped the locations of over 100,000 ice blocks
across the south polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus, thus
generating the first quantitative estimates of ice-block number
density distribution in relation to major geological features.
Ice blocks were manually identified and mapped from twenty of
the highest resolution (4--25 m per pixel) Cassini Imaging
Science Subsystem (ISS) narrow-angle images using ArcGIS
software. The 10--100 m-diameter positive-relief features are
marginally visible at the resolution of the images, making
ice-block identifications difficult but not impossible. Our
preliminary results reveal that ice blocks in the southern
hemisphere are systematically most concentrated within the
geologically active South Polar Terrain (SPT) and exhibit peak
concentrations within 20 km of the tiger-stripe fractures as
well as close to the south pole. We find that ice blocks are
concentrated just as heavily between tiger-stripe fractures as
on the directly adjacent margins; although significant local
fluctuations in ice-block number density do occur, we observe no
clear pattern with respect to the tiger stripes or jet sources.
We examine possible roles of several mechanisms for ice-block
origin, emplacement, and evolution: impact cratering, ejection
from fissures during cryovolcanic eruptions, tectonic disruption
of lithospheric ice, mass wasting, seismic disturbance, and
vapor condensation around icy fumeroles. We conclude that impact
cratering as well as mass wasting, perhaps triggered by seismic
events, cannot account for a majority of ice-block features
within the inner SPT. The pervasiveness of fracturing at many
size scales, the ubiquity of ice blocks in the inner SPT, as
well as the occurrence of linear block arrangements that
parallel through-cutting crack networks along the flanks of
tiger stripes indicate that tectonic deformation is an important
source of blocky-ice features in the SPT. Ejection during
catastrophic cryovolcanic eruptions and condensation around
surface vents, however, cannot be ruled out. Further,
sublimation processes likely erode and disaggregate ice blocks
from solid exposures of ice, especially near the warm
tiger-stripe fractures. The relative paucity of blocks beyond
the bounds of the SPT, particularly on stratigraphically old
cratered terrains, may be explained in part by mantling of the
surface by fine particulate ice grains that accumulate over
time.",

that the bright basin floors have a higher dielectric constant,

the interpretation that some of these basins may be filled with

also express a larger diffuse component to their backscatter,

Control by asthenospheric heating and implications for mountain
formation",
author="Kirchoff, Michelle R and McKinnon, William B and Schenk, Paul M",
abstract="Jupiter's moon Io possesses numerous tectonic mountains in
addition to its ubiquitous volcanoes and volcanic features.
Remarkably, a distinct global anticorrelation exists between the
spatial distribution of mountains and volcanic centers on Io.
This relationship indicates an explicit connection between
volcanism and mountain formation, even though the mountains are
tectonic in origin (predominantly upthrusted crustal blocks).
Spherical harmonic analysis shows the distribution of mountains
and volcanic centers have statistically significant power at
degree 2; this result is especially striking for the volcanic
center distribution, and directly implicates models of
asthenospheric tidal heating. The latter predict enhanced heat
flux along the equator in a degree-two pattern that matches
observations. Mountain formation on Io appears to be a form of
dominantly vertical tectonism unique in the modern Solar System:
continual burial by widespread volcanism drives the crust
inward, which leads to strong compression, and at discrete
locations, mountains. Correlation coefficients between the
volcanic and mountain distributions indicate statistically
meaningful anticorrelation at low spectral degrees (l = 1, 2, 4,
and 6); the anticorrelation is especially significant between
the longitudinal (sectorial) l = 2 components when considered on
their own. We compare this anticorrelation with published models
that link volcano and mountain formation. While consistent in
part with l = 2 convection models, which predict such an
anticorrelation (in principle), such low degree anticorrelations
are also (if not more) compatible with mountain formation due
to, or influenced by, thermal expansion of Io's crust, and deep
compression and thrust faulting in regions of lower than average
volcanic heat-piping. Positive correlations between mountain and
volcanic center distributions at high spectral degree may
reflect structural links between a good fraction of mountain
blocks and adjacent volcanic paterae, whereas the
anticorrelation at low degree implies that most volcanic
features (which are far more numerous overall) form
independently of mountains.",

abstract="The evolution of dense lower crust or lithosphere sinking from
below continental crust is analysed using numerical and
analytical models. The dripping and delamination mechanisms are
typically used to describe modern instabilities, but their
relative growth has not been quantified. Delamination is an
exponentially growing instability which scales in the same way as
for dripping, but grows more quickly by an order of magnitude.
Its growth-rate is highly dependent on the viscosity and
thickness of the lower crust which is captured in a scaling law.
If specific conditions for its initiation are not completely met,
a third mechanism called triggered dripping is activated. It is
practically indistinguishable from delamination, but its slower
growth is more similar to dripping. The characterisation of these
mechanisms leads to a general model in which relatively stronger
dense bodies must be recycled by delamination, requiring tectonic
activation, whereas weaker bodies are likely to drip. The
contrasting growth-rates of dripping and delamination can be used
to understand why modern instabilities often appear to grow
quickly and then stall. If an instability begins under conditions
suitable for delamination, but migrates into a zone of higher
lower crustal strength, it will revert to dripping and slow down
by at least a factor of five. The recycling of dense restitic
material from beneath Archean crust is explored by predicting how
its growth would compare to the intra-crustal instabilities
preserved as granite dome and greenstone keel structures. Using
the wavelength and lack of overprinting deformation of the
preserved granite domes as constraints, a specific crustal
viscosity profile can be inferred. Restite recycling and dome and
keel formation can plausibly occur simultaneously at the same
wavelength, as described by the growth of a single instability.
Restite could be trapped by a strong lithosphere and prevented
from recycling, but once reaching twice the thickness of the
granite, would rapidly sink through. The instability models are
consistent with constant, rapid recycling while the felsic lower
crust forms, before dome and keel formation is activated by
weakening of the greenstone layer and occurs simultaneously with
the recycling of any remaining restite. During the transition
from stagnant lid to mobile lid (plate tectonics) convection, a
large volume of lithospheric mantle is likely to have been
recycled. It is proposed that this generated a uniquely high
magnitude continental stress state which formed the cratonic
keels. Through mantle convection scale modelling, it is
demonstrated that depleted and therefore strong and buoyant
lithosphere forming within the lid can be shaped into thick keels
and survive the lid breaking event. The stress during their
formation is four times higher than the convective stresses
during mobile lid immediately afterwards. It would take a
Rayleigh number decrease of almost two orders of magnitude from
the initiation of tectonics to the present, to return the keels
to this stress state and predict their destruction. The stress at
subduction zones through time may have peaked at 75\% of the lid
breaking stress 1Ga ago. Any keel destruction on the modern Earth
is then predicted to require significant keel weakening, which is
consistent with observation.",

abstract="Abstract Numerous geological features that could be evaporitic
in origin have been identified on the surface of Titan. Although
they seem to be water--ice poor, their main properties --
chemical composition, thickness, stratification -- are
essentially unknown. In this paper, which follows on a previous
one focusing on the surface composition (Cordier, D., Barnes,
J.W., Ferreira, A.G. [2013b]. Icarus 226(2),1431--1437), we
provide some answers to these questions derived from a new
model. This model, based on the up-to-date thermodynamic theory
known as ``PC-SAFT'', has been validated with available
laboratory measurements and specifically developed for our
purpose. 1-D models confirm the possibility of an acetylene
and/or butane enriched central layer of evaporitic deposit. The
estimated thickness of this acetylene--butane layer could
explain the strong RADAR brightness of the evaporites. The 2-D
computations indicate an accumulation of poorly soluble species
at the deposit's margin. Among these species, HCN or aerosols
similar to tholins could play a dominant role. Our model
predicts the existence of chemically trimodal ``bathtub rings''
which is consistent with what it is observed at the south polar
lake Ontario Lacus. This work also provides plausible
explanations to the lack of evaporites in the south polar region
and to the high radar reflectivity of dry lakebeds.",

performed in January 1997 by the Short Wavelength Spectrometer
(SWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory in the wavelength range
from 5.3 to 7.0 $\mu$m (1422--1890 cm−1). This spectral interval
is of particular interest because it contains various molecular
transitions, particularly the $\nu$2 band of CH4 and the $\nu$8
band of C2H6, as well as a spectral feature characteristic of
the laboratory analogs of Titan's haze---or tholins---which have
been studied for decades. In addition, this region is expected
to show the transition between the thermal emission and
reflected sunlight regimes of Titan's atmospheric radiation
around 6 $\mu$m. All these features are indeed observed in the
SWS spectrum, for the first time in the case of the $\nu$2 band
of CH4 at 6.5 $\mu$m. We present a radiative transfer model of
these observations from which we derive the extinction cross
section of the haze particles at 140 $\pm$ 20 km altitude. This
result complements similar determinations recently obtained at
shorter and longer wavelengths from Cassini VIMS and CIRS
measurements, although large uncertainties still remain at
1700--1800 cm−1, as well as a gap at 1800--2000 cm−1. A
comparison between the available extinction cross section
determinations for the Titan haze and those derived for
laboratory-synthesized tholins, from the near- to the
far-infrared, shows some similarities but also striking
discrepancies, thus reinforcing the idea that there is not a
unique tholin analogue to the Titan haze material.",

Titan's atmosphere and surface and report initial results. The
model is a fully three-dimensional, modified version of NCAR's
terrestrial global climate model, CAM3. It includes forcing by
Saturn's gravitational tides; a treatment of the planetary
boundary layer and surface interactions; scattering and
absorption of short-wave radiation; absorption and emission of
long-wave radiation; thermal conduction in the soil, and a
package for computing atmospheric chemistry. The physical
properties and distribution of minor species and aerosols are
constrained by Cassini observations. The simulations do not
include the effects of a methane hydrological cycle, feedback
between radiative forcing and transport of radiatively active
minor species and aerosol, or aerosol microphysics. We report a
set of baseline results obtained after more than ∼30 Titan-years
of model integration. The model calculates a tropospheric
circulation that is in-family with the results from other
published GCMs, with a regime of weak retrograde winds
dominating the summer hemisphere and a band of weak prograde
winds appearing in the winter hemisphere. In the stratosphere,
the model produces a polar jet in the winter hemisphere, but its
peak velocity of 12 m s−1 is more than an order of magnitude
weaker than the winter polar jet inferred from observations. We
find that the globally integrated atmospheric angular momentum
(AAM) undergoes a semiannual oscillation similar to that
calculated by Tokano and Neubauer [Tokano, T., Neubauer, F.M.,
2005. Wind-induced seasonal angular momentum exchange at Titan's
surface and its influence on Titan's length-of-day. Geophys.
Res. Lett. 32, L24203--L24206], but delayed in seasonal phase by
30° of Ls. The associated transfer of angular momentum to the
surface implies that Titan's rate of rotation should be
accelerating during the epoch of Cassini Mission observations,
consistent with results obtained by the Cassini radar
investigation [Stiles, B.W., Kirk, R.L., Lorenz, R.D., Hensley,

Titan's spin state from Cassini RADAR images. Astron. J. 135,
1669--1680]. The amount of AAM transfer to the surface predicted
by the model, when combined with knowledge of the state of
rotation, points to a low value for Titan's effective moment of
inertia. As has been suggested [Lorenz, R.D., Stiles, B.W.,
Kirk, R.L., Allison, M.D., Persi del Marmo, P., Iess, L.,
Lunine, J.I., Ostro, S.J., Hensley, S., 2008. Titan's rotation
reveals an internal ocean and changing zonal winds. Science 319,
1649--1651], this may indicate significant decoupling between
Titan's outer crust and its mantle, possibly due to the presence
of an intervening subsurface ocean. We note, however, that
existing Titan GCMs, as presently formulated, do not yield
uniform results concerning AAM transfer to the surface and
ignore some physical processes that could potentially alter the
predicted magnitude and seasonal phasing of the transfer.",

abstract="Abstract The geologic history of the multi-ringed Argyre impact
basin and surroundings has been reconstructed on the basis of
geologic mapping and relative-age dating of rock materials and
structures. The impact formed a primary basin, rim materials,
and a complex basement structural fabric including faults and
valleys that are radial and concentric about the primary basin,
as well as structurally-controlled local basins. Since its
formation, the basin has been a regional catchment for volatiles
and sedimentary materials as well as a dominant influence on the
flow of surface ice, debris flows, and groundwater through and
over its basement structures. The basin is interpreted to have
been occupied by lakes, including a possible Mediterranean-sized
sea that formed in the aftermath of the Argyre impact event. The
hypothesized lakes froze and diminished through time, though
liquid water may have remained beneath the ice cover and
sedimentation may have continued for some time. At its deepest,
the main Argyre lake may have taken more than a hundred thousand
years to freeze to the bottom even absent any heat source
besides the Sun, but with impact-induced hydrothermal heat,
geothermal heat flow due to long-lived radioactivities in early
martian history, and concentration of solutes in sub-ice brine,
liquid water may have persisted beneath thick ice for many
millions of years. Existence of an ice-covered sea perhaps was
long enough for life to originate and evolve with gradually
colder and more hypersaline conditions. The Argyre rock
materials, diverse in origin and emplacement mechanisms, have
been modified by impact, magmatic, eolian, fluvial, lacustrine,
glacial, periglacial, alluvial, colluvial, and tectonic
processes. Post-impact adjustment of part of the
impact-generated basement structural fabric such as concentric
faults is apparent. Distinct basin-stratigraphic units are
interpreted to be linked to large-scale geologic activity far
from the basin, including growth of the Tharsis
magmatic--tectonic complex and the growth into southern middle
latitudes of south polar ice sheets. Along with the migration of
surface and sub-surface volatiles towards the central part of
the primary basin, the substantial difference in elevation with
respect to the surrounding highlands and Tharsis and the
Thaumasia highlands result in the trapping of atmospheric
volatiles within the basin in the form of fog and regional or
local precipitation, even today. In addition, the impact event
caused long-term (millions of years) hydrothermal activity, as
well as deep-seated basement structures that have tapped the
internal heat of Mars, as conduits, for far greater time,
possibly even today. This possibility is raised by the
observation of putative open-system pingos and nearby gullies
that occur in linear depressions with accompanying systems of
faults and fractures. Long-term water and heat energy
enrichment, complemented by the interaction of the
nutrient-enriched primordial crustal and mantle materials
favorable to life excavated to the surface and near-surface
environs through the Argyre impact event, has not only resulted
in distinct geomorphology, but also makes the Argyre basin a
potential site of exceptional astrobiological significance.",

abstract="Future planetary exploration of Titan will require higher
degrees of on-board automation, including autonomous
determination of sites where the probability of significant
scientific findings is the highest. In this paper, a novel
Artificial Intelligence (AI) method for the identification and
interpretation of sites that yield the highest potential of
cryovolcanic activity is presented. We introduce the theory of
fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) as a tool for the analysis of
remotely collected data in planetary exploration. A cognitive
model embedded in a fuzzy logic framework is constructed via the
synergistic interaction of planetary scientists and AI experts.
As an application example, we show how FCM can be employed to
solve the challenging problem of recognizing cryovolcanism from
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Cassini data. The fuzzy cognitive
map is constructed using what is currently known about
cryovolcanism on Titan and relies on geological mapping
performed by planetary scientists to interpret different locales
as cryovolcanic in nature. The system is not conceived to
replace the human scientific interpretation, but to enhance the
scientists' ability to deal with large amounts of data, and it
is a first step in designing AI systems that will be able, in
the future, to autonomously make decisions in situations where
human analysis and interpretation is not readily available or
could not be sufficiently timely. The proposed FCM is tested on
Cassini radar data to show the effectiveness of the system in
reaching conclusions put forward by human experts and published
in the literature. Four tests are performed using the Ta SAR
image (October 2004 fly-by). Two regions (i.e. Ganesa Macula and
the lobate high backscattering region East of Ganesa) are
interpreted by the designed FCM as exhibiting cryovolcanism in
agreement with the initial interpretation of the regions by
Stofan et al. (2006). Importantly, the proposed FCM is shown to
be flexible and adaptive as new data and knowledge are acquired
during the course of exploration. Subsequently, the FCM has been
modified to include topographic information derived from SAR
stereo data. With this additional information, the map concludes
that Ganesa Macula is not a cryovolcanic region. In conclusion,
the FCM methodology is shown to be a critical and powerful
component of future autonomous robotic spacecraft (e.g.,
orbiter(s), balloon(s), surface/lake lander(s), rover(s)) that

regularly changing geodynamic parameters. The main trends and
milestones of this evolution record irreversible cooling of the
Earth's interior, oxidation of the surface, and periodic changes
in geodynamic processes. The periodicity consists of cycles of
three characteristic sizes, namely 700--800 Myr global cycles,
120, 90, and 30 Myr smaller cycles, and short-period millennial
to decadal oscillations controlled by changing Earth's orbital
parameters and, possibly, also by other extraterrestrial
factors. Major events and estimates of mantle and surface
temperatures, heat flow, viscosity, and the respective regimes
of convection and plume magmatism have been reported for the
largest periods of the Earth's history: Hadean (4.6--3.9 Ga),
Early Archean (3.9--3.3 Ga), Late Archean (3.3--2.6 Ga), Early
Proterozoic (2.6--1.9 Ga), Middle Proterozoic (1.9--1.1 Ga),

of 0.6--0.3 and 0.3--0 Ga. Current geodynamics is discussed with
reference to models of spreading, subduction, and plume
activity. Spreading is considered in terms of double-layered
mantle convection, with focus on processes in the vicinity of
mid-ocean ridges. The problem of mafic melt migration through
the upper mantle beneath spreading ridges is treated
qualitatively. Main emphasis is placed on models of melting,
comparison of experimental and observed melt compositions, and
their variations in periods of magmatic activity (about 100 kyr
long) and quiescence. The extent and ways of interaction of
fluids and melts rising from subduction zones with the ambient
mantle remain the most controversial. Plume magmatism is
described with a ``gas torch'' model of thermochemical plumes
generated at the core-mantle boundary due to local chemical
doping with volatiles (H2, CH2, KH, etc.) which are released
from the metallic outer core, become oxidized in the lower

author="Gilliam, Ashley E and McKay, Christopher P",
abstract="Titan has a surface temperature of 94 K and a surface pressure
of 1.4 atmospheres. These conditions make it possible for liquid
methane solutions to be present on the surface. Here, we
consider how Titan could have liquid methane while orbiting
around an M4 red dwarf star, and a special case of Titan
orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 581. Because light from a red
dwarf star has a higher fraction of infrared than the Sun, more
of the starlight will reach the surface of Titan because its
atmospheric haze is more transparent to infrared wavelengths. If
Titan was placed at a distance from a red dwarf star such that
it received the same average flux as it receives from the Sun,
we calculate the increased infrared fraction, which will warm
surface temperatures by an additional ∼10 K. Compared to the
Sun, red dwarf stars have less blackbody ultraviolet light but
can have more Lyman $\alpha$ and particle radiation associated
with flares. Thus depending on the details, the haze production
may be much higher or much lower than for the current Titan.
With the haze reduced by a factor of 100, Titan would have a
surface temperature of 94 K at a distance of 0.23 AU from an M4
star and at a distance of 1.66 AU, for Gliese 581. If the haze
is increased by a factor of 100 the distances become 0.08 and
0.6 AU for the M4-star and Gliese 581, respectively. As a rogue

lithosphere topography are varied in a way to assess the general
influence of 3D geometry as well as a more specific tectonic
analogue of the Australian plate. Transient thermal events
offshore of the trailing passive margin are observed and include
plume migration, boundary layer instability growth at the
passive margin and variations in surface heat flux. The geometry
and plate velocity both play a significant role in controlling
the magnitude and duration of these transient features. In
particular, there are large differences between the different
models in the oceanic region downstream of the trailing edge of
the continent. At near-stationary plate speeds, cold linear
downwelling sheets propagate away from the 3D edge of the
continent, with regions offshore of the continents central axis
localising hot cylindrical upwelling plumes. At very fast plate
speeds, the shear flow is dominated by the plate motions. This
causes regions neighbouring the trailing edge of the continent
to produce broad, hot upwellings and the cold linear sheets to
migrate around the continent. At moderate (2 cm/yr) plate
speeds, oceanic lithosphere neighbouring the passive margin
along the trailing edge of the continent is buffered by cold,
downwelling instabilities sinking along the edges of the
continental lithosphere. Such neighbouring regions are subjected
to larger heat flux than for regions distant to the passive
margin, yet also record smaller and less variable vertical
surface velocities. These dynamics have implications for
volcanism and surface topography, for which 3D aspects play a
significant role.",

abstract="We use data from the VIMS instrument on board the Cassini
spacecraft to construct high sensitivity and high
spatial-resolution maps of the locations of tropospheric clouds
on Titan in the late northern winter season during which the
Cassini prime mission took place. These observations show that,
in this season, clouds on Titan are strongly hemispherically
asymmetric. Mid-latitude clouds, in particular, occur only in
the southern hemisphere and have not ever been observed in the
north. Such an asymmetry is in general agreement with
circulation models where sub-solar surface heating controls the
locations of clouds and appears in conflict with models where
perennial polar hazes prevent significant summertime polar
heating from affecting the circulation. The southern
mid-latitude clouds appear to be distributed uniformly in
longitude, in contrast to some previous observations. Southern
high-latitude clouds exhibit a significant concentration,
however, between about 180° and 270°E longitude. A spatially and
temporally uniform cloud always appears northward of ∼50°N
latitude. This cloud appears unchanged over the course of the
observations, consistent with the interpretation that it is
caused by continuous ethane condensation as air subsides and
radiatively cools through the tropopause. The location of this
cloud likely provides a direct tracer of elements of north polar
atmospheric circulation, potentially allowing continuous
monitoring of circulation changes as Titan passes through
equinox into north polar spring and summer. We show that a
similar analysis of this dataset by Rodriguez et al. (2009)

transport on the eve of the New Horizons encounter",
author="Toigo, Anthony D and French, Richard G and Gierasch, Peter J and
Guzewich, Scott D and Zhu, Xun and Richardson, Mark I",
abstract="Abstract Pluto's atmospheric dynamics occupy an interesting
regime in which the radiative time constant is quite long, the
combined effects of high obliquity and a highly eccentric orbit
can produce strong seasonal variations in atmospheric pressure,
and the strong coupling between the atmosphere and volatile
transport on the surface results in atmospheric flows that are
quite sensitive to surface and subsurface properties that at
present are poorly constrained by direct observations. In
anticipation of the New Horizons encounter with the Pluto system
in July 2015, we present a Pluto-specific three-dimensional
general circulation model (GCM), PlutoWRF, incorporating the
most accurate current radiative transfer models of Pluto's
atmosphere, a physically robust treatment of nitrogen volatile
transport, and the flexibility to accommodate richly detailed
information about the surface and subsurface conditions as new
data become available. We solve for a physically
self-consistent, equilibrated combination of surface,
subsurface, and atmospheric conditions to specify the boundary
conditions and initial state values for each GCM run. This is
accomplished using two reduced versions of PlutoWRF: a
two-dimensional surface volatile exchange model to specify the
properties of surface nitrogen ice and the initial atmospheric
surface pressure, and a one-dimensional
radiative--conductive--convective model that uses the
two-dimensional model predictions to determine the corresponding
global-mean atmospheric thermal profile. We illustrate the
capabilities of PlutoWRF in predicting Pluto's general
circulation, thermal state, and volatile transport of nitrogen
by calculating the dynamical response of Pluto's atmosphere,
based on four different idealized models of Pluto's surface ice
distribution from Young (Young, L.A. [2013]. Astrophys. J. 766,
L22) and Hansen et al. (Hansen, C.J., Paige, D.A., Young, L.A.
[2015]. Icarus 246, 183). Our GCM runs typically span 30 years,
from 1985 to 2015, covering the period from the discovery of
Pluto's atmosphere to present. For most periods simulated, zonal
winds are strongly forced by a gradient wind balance, relaxing
in later (recent) years to an angular momentum conservation
balance of the seasonal polar cap sublimation flow. Near-surface
winds generally follow a sublimation flow from the sunlit polar
cap to the polar night cap, with a Coriolis turning of the wind
as the air travels from pole to pole. We demonstrate the strong
contribution of nitrogen sublimation and deposition to Pluto's
atmospheric circulation. As New Horizons data become available,
PlutoWRF can be used to construct models of Pluto's atmospheric
dynamics and surface wind regimes more constrained by physical
observations.",

suggest a complex spatial and temporal interrelation between
volcanic and possibly water-related processes. We have produced
a series of self-consistent geological maps and a stratigraphic
correlation chart that show the spatial and temporal
distribution of volcanic, fluvial and tectonic processes. The
Amenthes region consists of a broad trough-like topographic
depression that has served as a path for the supply of materials
from Hesperia Planum to Isidis Planitia. It is most likely that
Hesperia Planum and, in particular the area north of Hesperia
Planum, including Tinto Vallis, Palos crater and the surrounding
dissected highlands have acted as a source region for materials
that were transported into the Amenthes trough and farther into
the Isidis basin. The Amenthes trough, as well as the graben of
Amenthes Fossae were formed after the Isidis impact in the
Noachian and represent likely the oldest features in the
Amenthes region. Dendritic valley networks, that bear evidence
for surface runoff, have dissected the highlands adjacent to
Amenthes Planum and within the Tinto Vallis and Palos crater
region before ∼3.7 Ga. The ridged volcanic plains located near
the Palos crater and Tinto Vallis region, within Amenthes Planum

between ∼3.5 and 3.2 Ga and represent the volcanic activity
which resulted in the flooding of the Amenthes trough. The
sinuous channel of Tinto Vallis was formed in the Hesperian
(≲3.5 Ga) and shows characteristics, which are consistent with
both ground water sapping and igneous processes. The Palos
crater outflow channel was formed nearly at the same time as
Tinto Vallis, between ∼3.5 Ga and ∼3.2 Ga and postdates the
volcanic flooding of the Amenthes trough in the Hesperian. Small
valleys (∼3.4--2.8 Ga) incised into the ridged plains of
Amenthes Planum appear also within the transitional plains

resultant plume. The UV--visible light curve peaks in brightness
18 s after impact and then decreases in radiance but never

ratio increases in the first 10 s, decreases over the following
50 s, remains constant for approximately 150 s, and then begins
to increase again ∼180 s after impact. Constraining the modeling
results with spacecraft observations, we conclude that lofted
dust grains remained suspended above the lunar surface for the
entire 250 s of observation after impact. The impact plume was
composed of both a high angle spike and low angle plume
component. Numerical modeling is used to evaluate the relative
effects of various plume parameters to further constrain the
plume properties when compared with the observational data. Dust

title="Supercontinents, mantle dynamics and plate tectonics: A
perspective based on conceptual vs. numerical models",
author="Yoshida, Masaki and Santosh, M",
abstract="The periodic assembly and dispersal of supercontinents through
the history of the Earth had considerable impact on mantle
dynamics and surface processes. Here we synthesize some of the
conceptual models on supercontinent amalgamation and disruption
and combine it with recent information from numerical studies to
provide a unified approach in understanding Wilson Cycle and
supercontinent cycle. Plate tectonic models predict that
superdownwelling along multiple subduction zones might provide
an effective mechanism to pull together dispersed continental
fragments into a closely packed assembly. The recycled subducted
material that accumulates at the mantle transition zone and
sinks down into the core--mantle boundary (CMB) provides the
potential fuel for the generation of plumes and superplumes
which ultimately fragment the supercontinent. Geological
evidence related to the disruption of two major supercontinents
(Columbia and Gondwana) attest to the involvement of plumes. The
re-assembly of dispersed continental fragments after the breakup
of a supercontinent occurs through complex processes involving
`introversion', `extroversion' or a combination of both, with
the closure of the intervening ocean occurring through
Pacific-type or Atlantic-type processes. The timescales of the
assembly and dispersion of supercontinents have varied through
the Earth history, and appear to be closely linked with the
processes and duration of superplume genesis. The widely held
view that the volume of continental crust has increased over
time has been challenged in recent works and current models
propose that plate tectonics creates and destroys Earth's
continental crust with more crust being destroyed than created.
The creation--destruction balance changes over a supercontinent
cycle, with a higher crustal growth through magmatic influx
during supercontinent break-up as compared to the tectonic
erosion and sediment-trapped subduction in convergent margins
associated with supercontinent assembly which erodes the
continental crust. Ongoing subduction erosion also occurs at the
leading edges of dispersing plates, which also contributes to
crustal destruction, although this is only a temporary process.
The previous numerical studies of mantle convection suggested
that there is a significant feedback between mantle convection
and continental drift. The process of assembly of
supercontinents induces a temperature increase beneath the
supercontinent due to the thermal insulating effect. Such
thermal insulation leads to a planetary-scale reorganization of
mantle flow and results in longest-wavelength thermal
heterogeneity in the mantle, i.e., degree-one convection in
three-dimensional spherical geometry. The formation of
degree-one convection seems to be integral to the emergence of
periodic supercontinent cycles. The rifting and breakup of
supercontinental assemblies may be caused by either tensional
stress due to the thermal insulating effect, or large-scale
partial melting resulting from the flow reorganization and
consequent temperature increase beneath the supercontinent.
Supercontinent breakup has also been correlated with the
temperature increase due to upwelling plumes originating from
the deeper lower mantle or CMB as a return flow of plate
subduction occurring at supercontinental margins. The active
mantle plumes from the CMB may disrupt the regularity of
supercontinent cycles. Two end-member scenarios can be envisaged
for the mantle convection cycle. One is that mantle convection
with dispersing continental blocks has a short-wavelength
structure, or close to degree-two structure as the present
Earth, and when a supercontinent forms, mantle convection
evolves into degree-one structure. Another is that mantle
convection with dispersing continental blocks has a degree-one
structure, and when a supercontinent forms, mantle convection
evolves into degree-two structure. In the case of the former
model, it would take longer time to form a supercontinent,
because continental blocks would be trapped by different
downwellings thus inhibiting collision. Although most of the
numerical studies have assumed the continent/supercontinent to
be rigid or nondeformable body mainly because of numerical
limitations as well as a simplification of models, a more recent
numerical study allows the modeling of mobile, deformable
continents, including oceanic plates, and successfully
reproduces continental drift similar to the processes and
timescales envisaged in Wilson Cycle.",

gone through extreme climatic perturbations, when extensive
glaciations occurred, together with alternating warm periods

of these two episodes of climatic oscillation preceded the

extreme climatic conditions existed between about 2.4 and 2.2

from the atmosphere, initiating a cooling trend that resulted in
continental glaciation. Ice cover prevented weathering so that
CO2 built up once more, causing collapse of the ice sheets and
ushering in a warm climatic episode. This negative feedback loop
provides a plausible explanation for multiple glaciations of the
Early and Late Proterozoic, and their intimate association with
sedimentary rocks formed in warm climates. Between each glacial
cycle nutrients were flushed into world oceans, stimulating
photosynthetic activity and causing oxygenation of the
atmosphere. Accommodation for many ancient glacial deposits was
provided by rifting but escape from the climatic cycle was
predicated on break-up of the supercontinent, when flooded
continental margins had a moderating influence on weathering.
The geochemistry of Neoproterozoic cap carbonates carries a
strong hydrothermal signal, suggesting that they precipitated
from deep sea waters, overturned and spilled onto continental
shelves at the termination of glaciations. Paleoproterozoic
(Huronian) carbonates of the Espanola Formation were probably
formed as a result of ponding and evaporation in a
hydrothermally influenced, restricted rift setting. Why did
metazoan evolution not take off after the Great Oxidation Event
of the Paleoproterozoic? The answer may lie in the huge scar
left by the ∼2023 Ma Vredefort impact in South Africa, and in
the worldwide organic carbon-rich deposits of the Shunga Event,
attesting to the near-extirpation of life and possible radical
alteration of the course of Earth history.",

abstract="Abstract The making of Pangea is the result of large-scale
amalgamation of continents and micro-continents, which started
at the end of the Neoproterozoic with the formation of Gondwana.
As pieces were added to Gondwana on its South-American,
Antarctica and Australia side, ribbon-like micro-continents were
detached from its African and South-Chinese side: Cadomia in the
late Neoproterozoic, Avalonia and Hunia in the Ordovician,
Galatia in the Devonian and Cimmeria in the Permian. Cadomia was
re-accreted to Gondwana, but the other ribbon-continents were
accreted to Baltica, North-China, Laurussia or Laurasia. Finding
the origin of these numerous terranes is a major geological
challenge. Recently, a global plate tectonic model was developed
together with a large geological/geodynamic database, at the
Lausanne University, covering the last 600 Ma of the Earth's
history. Special attention was given to the placing of Gondwana
derived terranes in their original position, using all possible
constraints. We propose here a solution for the Variscan
terranes, another paper deals with the Altaids. The Galatian
super-terrane was detached from Gondwana in the Devonian, during
the opening of Paleotethys, and was quickly separated into four
sub-terranes that started to by-pass each other. The leading
terranes collided at the end of the Devonian with the Hanseatic
terrane detached from Laurussia. In the Carboniferous, Gondwana
started to impinge onto the amalgamated terranes, creating the
Variscan chain and the Pangean super-continent. East of Spain
Paleotethys remained opened until the Triassic, subducting
northward under Laurasia. Roll-back of the Paleotethyan slab
triggered the collapse of most of the European Variscan orogen,
which was replaced by series of Permian rifts, some of them
becoming oceanized back-arc basins during the Triassic. Major
force changes at the Pangean plate limits at the end of the
Triassic provoked its break-up, through the opening of the
proto-Caribbean, central-Atlantic, Alpine-Tethys oceanic
seaways.",

abstract="Abstract The concept that the Mohorovicic Discontinuity (Moho)
does not necessarily coincide with the base of the continental
crust as defined by rock-type compositions was introduced in the
early 1980s. This had an important impact on understanding the
nature of the crust--mantle boundary using information from
seismology and from deep-seated samples brought to the surface
as xenoliths in magmas, or as tectonic terranes. The use of
empirically-constrained P--T estimates to plot the locus of
temperature vs depth for xenoliths defined a variety of
geotherms depending on tectonic environment. The xenolith
geotherms provided a framework for constructing lithological
sections through the deep lithosphere, and revealed that the
crust--mantle boundary in off-craton regions commonly is
transitional over a depth range of about 5--20 km. Early
seismic-reflection data showed common layering near the Moho,
correlating with the petrological observation of multiple
episodes of basaltic intrusion around the crust--mantle
boundary. Developments in seismology, petrophysics and
experimental petrology have refined interpretation of
lithospheric domains. The expansion of in situ geochronology
(especially zircon U--Pb ages and Hf-isotopes; Os isotopes of
mantle sulfides) has defined tectonic events that affected whole
crust--mantle sections, and revealed that the crust--mantle
boundary can change in depth through time. However, the nature
of the crust--mantle boundary in cratonic regions remains
enigmatic, mainly due to lack of key xenoliths or exposed
sections. The observation that the Moho may lie significantly
deeper than the crust--mantle boundary has important
implications for modeling the volume of the crust. Mapping the
crust using seismic techniques alone, without consideration of
the petrological problems, may lead to an overestimation of
crustal thickness by 15--30\%. This will propagate to large
uncertainties in the calculation of elemental mass balances
relevant to crust-formation processes, and the composition of
the convecting mantle.",

that three classes (small, intermediate and large) of tectonic

negative buoyancy of the mantle lithosphere. However, assuming
pressure dependent rheology, the thermal Rayleigh number
decreases due to the high pressure in super-Earths and thus the
magnitude of convection in the Moho decreases. Because reduced
convection in the Moho weakens the peeling of the mantle
lithosphere, the delaminated area is narrower. The magnitude of
the heat flux caused by the delamination process is also reduced
in planets large in size compared with Earth. Although further
work is needed, our model indicates that delamination can
transfer more heat than the conduction of the lithosphere if the

in general, the ratio of driving force to plate resistance
increases with planetary mass. This is a consequence of
increasing convective stresses, thinning plates and similar
plate structure. We conclude that even though the strength of
dry and wet of faults increases for massive terrestrial planets,
the convective stress increases even more allowing deformation
to take place. Also, despite shorter timescales for plate
cooling, rocky super-Earths achieve negative buoyancy at
subduction zones. Finally, by investigating the effects of
energy dissipation during subduction we find that massive
terrestrial planets dissipate less energy during subduction and
hence provide a positive feedback to sustain active-lid

evolve from an initial hot stagnant-lid condition, through an

abstract="Earth is the only terrestrial planet with present-day lithosphere
recycling through plate tectonics. However, theoretical models of
mantle convection based on general considerations find that all
the terrestrial planets should be operating in the stagnant lid
regime, in which the planets are one-plated and there is no
lithosphere recycling. The stagnant lid regime is a consequence
of the strong viscosity contrast across the convective layer, and
therefore the upper lid (roughly equivalent to the lithosphere)
must be sufficiently weakened in order to be mobilized. Here I
propose that giant impacts could have provided the upper layer
weakening required for surface recycling, and hence for plate
tectonics, to initiate on the early Earth. Additionally, giant
impacts originated lithosphere thickness and density differences,
which might contribute to the initiation of subduction. Impacts
are more energetic for Earth than for Mars, which could explain
the likely early existence of plate tectonics on the Earth
whereas Mars never had lithosphere recycling. On the other hand,
convection on Mercury and the Moon might be sluggish or even
inexistent, implying a reduced influence of giant impacts on
their internal dynamics, whereas there is no record of the

title="Styles of mantle convection and their influence on planetary
evolution",
author="Stevenson, David J",
abstract="Mantle convection is the method of heat elimination for silicate
mantles in terrestrial bodies, provided they are not too small or
too hot. Bodies that are small (∼Moon or smaller, possibly even
Mercury) may rely largely on conduction or melt migration, and
bodies that are very hot (Io, very early Earth) may use massive
melt migration (magma oceans) and heat pipes. In the standard,
simple picture, we can use scaling laws to determine the secular
cooling of a planet, likelihood and form of volcanism, and the
possibility of a core dynamo. Contrary to popular belief, small
planets do not cool faster than larger planets (provided they
convect) but they do tend to have a slightly lower internal
temperature at all times and thus may cease to be volcanically
active at an earlier epoch. On the other hand, a larger volume
fraction of a small planet may be involved in melt generation.
However, our understanding of heat transfer by mantle convection
is limited by three very important, largely unsolved problems:
The complexities of rheology, the effects of compositional
gradients, and the effects of phase transitions, especially
melting. The most striking manifestation of the role of rheology
lies in the difference between a mobile lid mode (plate tectonics
for Earth) and a stagnant lid mode (other large terrestrial
bodies). This difference may arise because of the role of water,
but perhaps also because of melting, or size (gravity), or the
vagaries of history. It has profound effects for the differences
in history of Earth, Venus and Mars, including their surface
geology, volatile reservoirs and magnetic fields. Since thermal
convection is driven by small density differences, it can also be
greatly altered or limited by compositional or phase effects.
Melt migration introduces additional complications to the heat
transport as well as being a source for the irreversible
differentiation that might promote layering. Our limited
understanding and ability to model these processes continues to
limit the development of a predictive framework for the

negative buoyancy of the thermal boundary layer resulting in
subduction. Although the signature of plate tectonics is
recognized with some confidence in the Phanerozoic geological
record of the continents, evidence for plate tectonics becomes
less certain further back in time. To improve our understanding
of plate tectonics on the Earth in the Precambrian we have to
combine knowledge derived from the geological record with
results from well-constrained numerical modeling. In a series of
experiments using a 2D petrological--thermomechanical numerical
model of oceanic subduction we have systematically investigated
the dependence of tectono-metamorphic and magmatic regimes at an
active plate margin on upper-mantle temperature, crustal
radiogenic heat production, degree of lithospheric weakening and
other parameters. We have identified a first-order transition
from a ``no-subduction'' tectonic regime through a
``pre-subduction'' tectonic regime to the modern style of
subduction. The first transition is gradual and occurs at
upper-mantle temperatures between 250 and 200 K above the
present-day values, whereas the second transition is more abrupt
and occurs at 175--160 K. The link between geological
observations and model results suggests that the transition to
the modern plate tectonic regime might have occurred during the
Mesoarchean--Neoarchean time (ca. 3.2--2.5 Ga). In the case of
the ``pre-subduction'' tectonic regime (upper-mantle temperature
175--250 K above the present) the plates are weakened by intense
percolation of melts derived from the underlying hot
melt-bearing sub-lithospheric mantle. In such cases, convergence
does not produce self-sustaining one-sided subduction, but
rather results in shallow underthrusting of the oceanic plate
under the continental plate. Further increase in the
upper-mantle temperature (> 250 K above the present) causes a
transition to a ``no-subduction'' regime where horizontal
movements of small deformable plate fragments are accommodated
by internal strain and even shallow underthrusts do not form
under the imposed convergence. Thus, based on the results of the
numerical modeling, we suggest that the crucial parameter
controlling the tectonic regime is the degree of lithospheric
weakening induced by emplacement of sub-lithospheric melts into
the lithosphere. A lower melt flux at upper-mantle temperatures
< 175--160 K results in a lesser degree of melt-related
weakening leading to stronger plates, which stabilizes modern

colliding, splitting and aggregating. The evolutions of the
continent configuration, as well as oceanic plate tectonics, are
surface expressions of mantle convection and closely linked to
the thermal state of the mantle; however, quantitative studies
are so far lacking. In the present study we use 3D spherical
numerical simulations with self-consistently generated plates
and compositionally and rheologically distinct continents
floating at the top of the mantle in order to investigate the
feedbacks between continental drift, oceanic plate tectonics and
the thermal state of the Earth's mantle, by using different
continent configurations ranging from one supercontinent to six
small continents. With the presence of a supercontinent we find
a strong time-dependence of the oceanic surface heat flow and
suboceanic mantle temperature, driven by the generation of new
plate boundaries. Very large oceanic plates correlate with
periods of hot suboceanic mantle, while the mantle below smaller
oceanic plates tends to be colder. Temperature fluctuations of
subcontinental mantle are significantly smaller than in oceanic
regions and are caused by a time-variable efficiency of thermal
insulation of the continental convection cell. With the presence
of multiple continents the temperature below individual
continents is generally lower than below supercontinent and is
more time-dependent, with fluctuations as large as 15\% that are
caused by continental assembly and dispersal. The periods
featuring a hot subcontinental mantle correlate with strong
clustering of the continents and periods characterized by cold
subcontinental mantle, at which it can even be colder than
suboceanic mantle, with a more dispersed continent
configuration. Our findings with multiple continents imply that
periods of partial melting and strong magmatic activity inside
the continents, which may contribute to continental rifting and
pronounced growth of continental crust, might be episodic
processes related to the supercontinent cycle. Finally, we

convecting mantle system for billions of years has long been
studied by the geodynamical community. High strength of the

factor, but the role of lithospheric mantle depletion and
dehydration in this strengthening is still debated. Geodynamical
models often argue for a significant strength or buoyancy
contrast between cratonic and non-cratonic mantle lithosphere,
induced by mantle depletion and dehydration. But recent
laboratory experiments argue for only a modest effect of
dehydration strengthening. Can we reconcile laboratory
experiments and geodynamical models? We perform and discuss new
numerical models to investigate craton stability and longevity
with different composition-dependent rheology and buoyancy. Our
results show that highly viscous and possibly buoyant cratonic
root is essential to stabilise a geometry in which thick

coexist for billions of years. Using non-Newtonian rheology, a
modest strengthening factor of $\Delta$ $\eta$ = 3 can protect
compositionally buoyant cratonic roots from erosion by mantle
convection for over billions of years. A larger strengthening
factor ( $\Delta$ $\eta$ = 10 ) can maintain long term craton
stability even with little or no intrinsic buoyancy. Such
composition-dependent rheology is comparable to the laboratory

predictions are not supported by current data. The quiet
interval includes a greater extent of contractional orogenesis
and a broader range of paleopressures than previously known and
is not characterized by LP--HT metamorphism proposed to have
been related to higher upper mantle temperatures from decreased
upper mantle cooling. Glacial conditions do not appear to have
been triggered by the coincidence of the onset of magmatic
shutdown with the end of mass-independent sulphur isotope
fractionation and oxygenation of the atmosphere, as the initial
glacial episodes predate this time. The glacial record,
moreover, requires four episodes of climatic amelioration during
the proposed shutdown, for which a mechanism appears lacking. A
purported gap in Large-Igneous-Province formation, related to
decreased mantle vigour, is not apparent. Quiet interval
magmatism includes juvenile, arc-type and TTG magmatism,
supporting significant crustal additions on a number of cratons.
The prediction of negligible plate velocities during shutdown is
not borne out by the well-constrained Superior Province
paleomagnetic record. We suggest that plate tectonics did not
shut down but that the Siderian Quiet Interval represents
overall diminished tectonic activity during peripheral
orogenesis, as is known for other relatively quiet periods
following supercontinent or supercraton amalgamation.",

self-regulation of viscosity",
author="Tackley, P J and Ammann, M and Brodholt, J P and Dobson, D P and
Valencia, D",
abstract="Abstract The discovery of extra-solar ``super-Earth'' planets
with sizes up to twice that of Earth has prompted interest in
their possible lithosphere and mantle dynamics and evolution.
Simple scalings suggest that super-Earths are more likely than
an equivalent Earth-sized planet to be undergoing plate
tectonics. Generally, viscosity and thermal conductivity
increase with pressure while thermal expansivity decreases,
resulting in lower convective vigour in the deep mantle, which,
if extralopated to the largest super-Earths might, according to
conventional thinking, result in no convection in their deep
mantles due to the very low effective Rayleigh number. Here we
evaluate this. First, as the mantle of a super-Earth is made
mostly of post-perovskite we here extend the density functional
theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy
of to a pressure of 1 TPa, for both slowest diffusion
(upper-bound rheology) and fastest diffusion (lower-bound
rheology) directions. Along a 1600 K adiabat the upper-bound
rheology would lead to a post-perovskite layer of a very high
(∼1030 Pa s) but relatively uniform viscosity, whereas the
lower-bound rheology leads to a post-perovskite viscosity
increase of ∼7 orders of magnitude with depth; in both cases the
deep mantle viscosity would be too high for convection. Second,
we use these DFT-calculated values in statistically steady-state
numerical simulations of mantle convection and lithosphere
dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models
assume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of
material properties and plastic yielding induced plate-like
lithospheric behaviour. Results confirm the likelihood of plate
tectonics for planets with Earth-like surface conditions
(temperature and water) and show a self-regulation of deep
mantle temperature. The deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead
feedback between internal heating, temperature and viscosity
regulates the temperature such that the viscosity has the value
needed to facilitate convective loss of the radiogenic heat,
which results in a very hot perovskite layer for the upper-bound
rheology, a super-adiabatic perovskite layer for the lower-bound
rheology, and an azimuthally-averaged viscosity of no more than
1026 Pa s. Convection in large super-Earths is characterised by
large upwellings (even with zero basal heating) and small,
time-dependent downwellings, which for large super-Earths merge
into broad downwellings. In the context of planetary evolution,
if, as is likely, a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten after
its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of
years its deep interior is still extremely hot and possibly
substantially molten with a ``super basal magma ocean'' -- a
larger version of the proposal of Labrosse et al. (Labrosse, S.,
Hernlund, J.W., Coltice, N. [2007]. Nature 450, 866--869),

important boundary inside our planet, with processes occurring

seen an astonishing improvement in our knowledge of this region
due to improvements in seismological data and techniques for
mapping both large- and small-scale structures, mineral physics
discoveries such as post-perovskite and the iron spin

increasingly revealed as a very complex region characterised by
large variations in temperature and composition, phase changes,
melting (possibly at present and certainly in the past), and
anisotropic structures. Here, some fundamentals of the relevant
processes and uncertainties are reviewed in the context of
long-term Earth evolution and how it has led to the observed
present-day structures. Melting has been a dominant process in
Earth's evolution. Several processes involving melting, some of
which operated soon after Earth's formation and some of which
operated throughout its history, have produced dense, iron rich
material that has likely sunk to the deepest mantle to be
incorporated into a heterogeneous basal m{\'e}lange (BAM) that
is now evident seismically as two large low-velocity regions
under African and the Pacific, but was probably much larger in
the past. This BAM modulates core heat flux, plume formation and
the separation of different slab components, and may contain
various trace-element cocktails required to explain geochemical
observations. The geographical location of BAM material has,
however, probably changed through Earth's history due to the
inherent time-dependence of plate tectonics and continental

title="The role of solid--solid phase transitions in mantle convection",
author="Faccenda, Manuele and Dal Zilio, Luca",
abstract="Abstract With changing pressure and temperature conditions,
downwelling and upwelling crustal and mantle rocks experience
several solid--solid phase transitions that affect the mineral
physical properties owing to structural changes in the crystal
lattice and to the absorption or release of latent heat.
Variations in density, together with phase boundary deflections
related to the non-null reaction slope, generate important
buoyancy forces that add to those induced by thermal
perturbations. These buoyancy forces are proportional to the
density contrast between reactant and product phases, their
volume fraction, the slope and the sharpness of the reaction,
and affect the style of mantle convection depending on the
system composition. In a homogeneous pyrolitic mantle there is
little tendency for layered convection, with slabs that may
stagnate in the transition zone because of the positive buoyancy
caused by post-spinel and post-ilmenite reactions, and hot
plumes that are accelerated by phase transformations in the
600--800 km depth range. By adding chemical and mineralogical
heterogeneities as on Earth, phase transitions introduce bulk
rock and volatiles filtering effects that generate a
compositional gradient throughout the entire mantle, with levels
that are enriched or depleted in one or more of these
components. Phase transitions often lead to mechanical softening
or hardening that can be related to a different intrinsic
mechanical behaviour and volatile solubility of the product
phases, the heating or cooling associated with latent heat, and
the transient grain size reduction in downwelling cold material.
Strong variations in viscosity would enhance layered mantle
convection, causing slab stagnation and plume ponding. At low
temperatures and relatively dry conditions, reactions are
delayed due to the sluggish kinetics, so that non-equilibrium
phase aggregates can persist metastably beyond the equilibrium
phase boundary. Survival of low-density metastable olivine,
Ringwoodite, pyroxene and pyrope garnet in the transition zone
and uppermost lower mantle produces positive buoyancy forces
that decrease the subduction velocity and may lead to slab
stagnation in the transition zone. The presence of deep
metastable portions is still debated, and should not be
associated a-priori with a completely dry slab as field
observations suggest that heterogeneously hydrated oceanic
plates could contain metastable dry portions surrounded by
transformed wet rocks.",

Ediacaran times is demonstrated by conformity of palaeomagnetic
poles to near-static positions between ∼2.7--2.2 Ga, ∼1.5--1.2
Ga and ∼0.75--0.6 Ga. Intervening data accord to coherent APW
loops turning at ``hairpins'' focused near a continental-centric
location. Although peripheral adjustments occurred during Early
Proterozoic (∼2.2 Ga) and Grenville (∼1.1 Ga) times, the crust
retained a low order symmetrical crescent-shaped form
constrained to a single global hemisphere until break-up in
Ediacaran times. Conformity of palaeomagnetic data to specific
Eulerian parameters enables definition of a master Precambrian
APW path used to estimate the root mean square velocity (vRMS)
of continental crust between 2.8 and 0.6 Ga. A long interval of
little polar movement between ∼2.7 and 2.2 Ga correlates with
global magmatic shutdown between ∼2.45 and 2.2 Ga, whilst this
interval and later slowdown at ∼0.75--0.6 Ga to velocities of <2
cm/year correlate with episodes of widespread glaciation
implying that these prolonged climatic anomalies had an internal
origin; the reduced input of volcanically-derived atmospheric
greenhouse gases is inferred to have permitted freeze-over
conditions with active ice sheets extending into equatorial
latitudes as established by low magnetic inclinations in
glaciogenic deposits. vRMS variations through Precambrian times
correspond to the distribution of U-Pb ages in orogenic
granitoids and detrital zircons and demonstrate that mobility of
continental crust has been closely related to crustal tectonism
and incrementation. Both periods of near-stillstand were
followed by rapid vRMS recording massive heat release from
beneath the continental lid at ∼2.2 and 0.6 Ga. The first
coincided with the Lomagundi-Jatuli isotopic event and led to
prolonged orogenesis accompanied by continental flooding and
reconfiguration of the crust on the Earth's surface; the second
led to continental break-up and instigated the comprehensive
Plate Tectonics that has characterised Phanerozoic times. The
Mesoproterozoic interval characterised by anorogenic magmatism
correlates with low vRMS between ∼1.5 and 1.1 Ga. Insulation of
the sub-continental mantle evidently permitted high temperature

title="The boring billion? -- Lid tectonics, continental growth and
environmental change associated with the Columbia supercontinent",
author="Roberts, Nick M W",
abstract="Abstract The evolution of Earth's biosphere, atmosphere and
hydrosphere is tied to the formation of continental crust and its
subsequent movements on tectonic plates. The supercontinent cycle
posits that the continental crust is periodically amalgamated
into a single landmass, subsequently breaking up and dispersing
into various continental fragments. Columbia is possibly the
first true supercontinent, it amalgamated during the 2.0--1.7 Ga
period, and collisional orogenesis resulting from its formation
peaked at 1.95--1.85 Ga. Geological and palaeomagnetic evidence
indicate that Columbia remained as a quasi-integral continental
lid until at least 1.3 Ga. Numerous break-up attempts are
evidenced by dyke swarms with a large temporal and spatial range;
however, palaeomagnetic and geologic evidence suggest these
attempts remained unsuccessful. Rather than dispersing into
continental fragments, the Columbia supercontinent underwent only
minor modifications to form the next supercontinent (Rodinia) at
1.1--0.9 Ga; these included the transformation of external
accretionary belts into the internal Grenville and equivalent
collisional belts. Although Columbia provides evidence for a form
of `lid tectonics', modern style plate tectonics occurred on its
periphery in the form of accretionary orogens. The detrital
zircon and preserved geological record are compatible with an
increase in the volume of continental crust during Columbia's
lifespan; this is a consequence of the continuous accretionary
processes along its margins. The quiescence in plate tectonic
movements during Columbia's lifespan is correlative with a long
period of stability in Earth's atmospheric and oceanic chemistry.
Increased variability starting at 1.3 Ga in the environmental
record coincides with the transformation of Columbia to Rodinia;
thus, the link between plate tectonics and environmental change
is strengthened with this interpretation of supercontinent
history.",

Frost, D J",
abstract="Abstract In order to test accretion simulations as well as
planetary differentiation scenarios, we have integrated a
multistage core--mantle differentiation model with N-body
accretion simulations. Impacts between embryos and planetesimals
are considered to result in magma ocean formation and episodes
of core formation. The core formation model combines rigorous
chemical mass balance with metal--silicate element partitioning
data and requires that the bulk compositions of all starting
embryos and planetesimals are defined as a function of their
heliocentric distances of origin. To do this, we assume that
non-volatile elements are present in Solar System (CI) relative
abundances in all bodies and that oxygen and H2O contents are
the main compositional variables. The primary constraint on the
combined model is the composition of the Earth's primitive
mantle. In addition, we aim to reproduce the composition of the
martian mantle and the mass fractions of the metallic cores of
Earth and Mars. The model is refined by least squares
minimization with up to five fitting parameters that consist of
the metal--silicate equilibration pressure and 1--4 parameters
that define the starting compositions of primitive bodies. This
integrated model has been applied to six Grand Tack N-body
accretion simulations. Investigations of a broad parameter space
indicate that: (1) accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, (2)
metal--silicate equilibration pressures increase as accretion
progresses and are, on average, 60--70\% of core--mantle
boundary pressures at the time of each impact, and (3) a large
fraction (70--100\%) of the metal of impactor cores equilibrates
with a small fraction of the silicate mantles of proto-planets
during each core formation event. Results are highly sensitive
to the compositional model for the primitive starting bodies and
several accretion/core-formation models can thus be excluded.
Acceptable fits to the Earth's mantle composition are obtained
only when bodies that originated close to the Sun, at <0.9--1.2
AU, are highly reduced and those from beyond this distance are
increasingly oxidized. Reasonable concentrations of H2O in
Earth's mantle are obtained when bodies originating from beyond
6--7 AU contain 20 wt\% water ice (icy bodies that originated
between the snow line and this distance did not contribute to
Earth's accretion because they were swept up by Jupiter and
Saturn). In the six models examined, water is added to the Earth
mainly after 60--80\% of its final mass has accreted. The
compositional evolution of the mantles of Venus and Mars are
also constrained by the model. The FeO content of the martian
mantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which
the Mars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth's core is
predicted to contain 8--9 wt\% silicon, 2--4 wt\% oxygen and
10--60 ppm hydrogen, whereas the martian core is predicted to
contain low concentrations (<1 wt\%) of Si and O.",

abstract="Abstract Since the late 1970s studies of the oceanic crust using
airgun sources and towed hydrophone arrays have been conducted
in a wide range of ocean basin settings including mid-ocean
ridges and old oceanic crust. The very earliest studies were
performed at the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) and
revealed a very distinct almost continuous vertical incidence
reflection event at a depth corresponding to the crust--mantle
transition as inferred from seismic refraction studies. This
suggested that the transition was quite sharp in comparison to
the source wavelength. That Moho was observed very close to or
even exactly beneath the ridge crest implied that it was formed
at essentially zero age. Since then, many experiments using
progressively improving airgun arrays and streamer systems have
expanded these observations. Here we review the literature
presenting studies of ``normal'' oceanic crust produced at
mid-ocean ridges with the objective of assessing the age of
formation of Moho and the nature of variability of Moho
signature in multi-channel seismic data. Moho is observed as a
consistent feature for all spreading rates but appears quite
variable, being very distinct in some areas, complex in form in
others and absent in many regions (as much as 40\%). Although
fast-spread crust is associated with the strongest, simplest and
most laterally continuous Moho images we see significant
variability at almost all spreading rates and ages. Where Moho
is absent from vertical incidence data this cannot be fully
explained by the effect of scattering or attenuation in the
crustal section above. Moho can be observed at zero age in only
a small number of areas at or near Overlapping Spreading Centers

distribution, described by either one (Sornette and Pisarenko,

characterised by large and small plate size. A unique
distribution implies a hierarchical structure from the largest
to the smallest plate. Alternatively, two distributions indicate
distinct evolutionary laws for large and small plates, the first
tied to mantle flow, the second determined by a hierarchical
fragmentation process. We analyse detailed reconstructions of
plate boundaries during the last 200 Myr and find that (i) large
and small plates display distinct statistical distributions,
(ii) the small plates display little organisational change since
60 Ma and (iii) the large plates oscillate between heterogeneous
(200--170 Myr and 65--50 Ma) and homogeneous (120--100 Ma) plate
tessellations on a timescale of about 100 Myr. Heterogeneous
states are reached more rapidly, while the plate configuration
decays into homogeneous states following a slower asymptotic

states while homogeneous tessellations are equilibrium states.

scales is a firmly established practice in the geodynamics
community. As our depth of understanding grows, and hand-in-hand
with improvements in analytical techniques and higher resolution
remote sensing of the physical structure and state of the Earth,
there is a continual need to develop more efficient, accurate
and reliable numerical techniques. This is necessary to ensure
that we can meet the challenge of generating robust conclusions,
interpretations and predictions from improved observations. In
adaptive numerical methods, the desire is generally to maximise
the quality of the numerical solution for a given amount of
computational effort. Neither of these terms has a unique,
universal definition, but typically there is a trade off between
the number of unknowns we can calculate to obtain a more
accurate representation of the Earth, and the resources (time
and computational memory) required to compute them. In the
engineering community, this topic has been extensively examined
using the adaptive finite element (AFE) method. Recently, the
applicability of this technique to geodynamic processes has
started to be explored. In this review we report on the current
status and usage of spatially adaptive finite element analysis
in the field of geodynamics. The objective of this review is to
provide a brief introduction to the area of spatially adaptive
finite analysis, including a summary of different techniques to
define spatial adaptation and of different approaches to guide
the adaptive process in order to control the discretisation

related to using adaptive analysis techniques and perspectives

author="O'Neill, C and Jellinek, A M and Lenardic, A",
abstract="Plate tectonics on Earth is driven by the subduction and stirring
of dense oceanic lithosphere into the underlying mantle. For such
a regime to exist on any planet, stresses associated with mantle
convection must exceed the strength of the lithosphere. This
condition is sufficiently restrictive that plate tectonics
currently operates only on Earth, and mantle convection in most
terrestrial planets and moons is probably in a stagnant lid
regime. Convective stresses on the lithosphere depend on the
viscosity and velocity of underlying cold downwellings. The
lithospheric yield stress is controlled by its friction
coefficient and elastic thickness (the depth to the
brittle--ductile transition or BDT). Both convective stresses and
the plate's yield strength depend critically on the size, thermal
state and cooling history of a planet. Accordingly, here we use
numerical simulations and scaling theory to identify conditions
in which mantle convection leads to lithospheric failure for a
range of conditions relevant to the terrestrial planets. Whereas
Earth is expected to be in a plate-tectonic regime over its full
thermal evolution, the Moon and Mercury are expected to have
always remained in a stagnant lid regime. Venus, Io and Europa
currently fall on the transition between the two regimes, which
is consistent with an episodic style of mantle convection for
Venus, a tectonic component to deformation on Io, and the
resurfacing history and lithospheric evolution of Europa. Our
results suggest that Venus may have been in a plate-tectonic
regime in the past. While stagnant now, it is plausible that Mars
may have also been in an active-lid regime, depending on whether
there was liquid water on the surface.",

abstract="It is generally assumed that continents, acting as thermal
insulation above the convecting mantle, inhibit the Earth's
internal heat loss. We present theory, numerical simulations, and
laboratory experiments to test the validity of this intuitive and
commonly used assumption. A scaling theory is developed to
predict heat flow from a convecting mantle partially covered by
stable continental lithosphere. The theory predicts that
parameter regimes exist for which increased continental
insulation has no effect on mantle heat flow and can even enhance
it. Partial insulation leads to increased internal mantle
temperature and decreased viscosity. This, in turn, allows for
the more rapid overturn of oceanic lithosphere and increased
oceanic heat flux. Depending on the ratio of continental to
oceanic surface area, global mantle heat flow can remain constant
or even increase as a result. Theoretical scaling analyses are
consistent with results from numerical simulations and laboratory
experiments. Applying our results to the Earth we find, in
contrast to conventional understanding, that continental
insulation does not generally reduce global heat flow. Such
insulation can have a negligible effect or even enhance mantle
cooling, depending on the magnitude of the temperature dependence
of mantle viscosity. The theory also suggests a potential
constraint on continental surface area. Increased surface area
enhances the subduction rate of oceanic lithosphere. If
continents are produced in subduction settings this could enhance
continental growth up to a critical point where increased
insulation causes convective stress levels to drop to values
approaching the lithospheric yield stress. This condition makes
weak plate margins difficult to maintain which, in turn, lowers
subduction rates and limits the further growth of continents. The
theory is used to predict the critical point as a function of
mantle heat flow. For the Earth's rate of mantle heat loss, the
predicted continental surface area is in accord with the observed
value.",

iron spin transition",
author="Justo, J F and Morra, G and Yuen, D A",
abstract="Abstract A proper determination of the lower-mantle viscosity
profile is fundamental to understanding Earth geodynamics. Based
on results coming from different sources, several models have
been proposed to constrain the variations of viscosity as a
function of pressure, stress and temperature. While some models
have proposed a relatively modest viscosity variation across the
lower mantle, others have proposed variations of several orders
of magnitude. Here, we have determined the viscosity of
ferropericlase, a major mantle mineral, and explored the role of
the iron high-to-low spin transition. Viscosity was described
within the elastic strain energy model, in which the activation
parameters are obtained from the bulk and shear wave velocities.
Those velocities were computed combining first principles total
energy calculations and the quasi-harmonic approximation. As a
result of a strong elasticity softening across the spin
transition, there is a large reduction in the activation free
energies of the materials creep properties, leading to viscosity
undulations. These results suggest that the variations of the
viscosity across the lower mantle, resulting from geoid inversion
and postglacial rebound studies, may be caused by the iron spin
transition in mantle minerals. Implications of the undulated
lower mantle viscosity profile exist for both, down- and
up-wellings in the mantle. We find that a viscosity profile
characterized by an activation free energy of G ⁎ ( z 0 ) ∼ 300

$\delta$ = 0.5 better fits the observed high velocity layer at

the Archean and Proterozoic",

abstract="The operation and extent of modern-style plate tectonics in the
Archean and Paleoproterozoic are controversial, although
subduction and terrane accretion models have been proposed for
most Archean cratons in the world, including both the Yilgarn
and Pilbara Cratons of Western Australia. The recognition of
ancient island arcs can be used to infer convergent plate margin
processes, and in this paper we present evidence for the
existence of several intraoceanic island arcs now preserved in
Australia. Beginning in the Archean, Australia evolved to its
present configuration through the accretion and assembly of
several continental blocks, by convergent plate margin
processes. In Australia, possibly the best example of an Archean
island arc (or primitive continental arc) is preserved within
the Mesoarchean (ca. 3130--3112 Ma) Whundo Group in the Sholl
Terrane of the West Pilbara Superterrane. Two younger,
Neoarchean, island arc terranes, and associated accretion, have
also been proposed for the Yilgarn Craton: the Saddleback island
arc (ca. 2714--2665 Ma) in the southwest Yilgarn Craton and the
Kurnalpi island arc (ca. 2719--2672 Ma) in the eastern Yilgarn
Craton. In the early Proterozoic, in the Central Zone of the
Halls Creek Orogen, northern Western Australia, the Tickalara
Metamorphics (ca. 1865--1850 Ma) have been interpreted to
represent an island arc. In the southwest Gawler Craton in South
Australia, the St Peter Suite (ca. 1631--1608 Ma), of juvenile
I-type calcalkaline tonalite to granodiorite, possibly
represents an island arc. In the Musgrave Province in central
Australia, age and geochemical constraints are poor due to later
overprinting tectonic events, but felsic orthogneisses (ca.
1607--1565 Ma) possibly represent juvenile felsic crust which
was emplaced though subduction-related processes into an oceanic
island arc. The arcs are volumetrically insignificant, but
important, in that they separate much larger tracts of, usually
older, continental crust, often of different composition and
geological history. The arcs were sutured to continental crust
during arc--continent collisional events, which eventually
resulted in the assembly of much of present-day Australia. The
arcs, thus, indicate lost oceanic crust. The recognition of
island arcs in the ancient rock record indicates that subduction
processes, similar in many ways to modern day processes at
convergent plate margins, were operating on Earth by at least
3100 Ma ago.",

title="Plate tectonics on rocky exoplanets: Influence of initial
conditions and mantle rheology",
author="Noack, Lena and Breuer, Doris",
abstract="Abstract Several numerical studies have been published in the
past years speculating about the existence of plate tectonics on
large exoplanets. They focus on aspects like the mass of a
planet, the interior heating rate and the occurrence of water in
the mantle. Different trends in the propensity for plate
tectonics have been observed in particular when varying the
planetary mass: with increasing mass the surface mobilization is
found to be either more, equally or less likely than on Earth.
These studies and their implications are, however, difficult to
compare as they assume different initial conditions and
parameter sets, and either neglect the pressure effect on the
viscosity or assume a rather small influence of the pressure on
the rheology. Furthermore, the thermal evolution of the planets
(i.e. cooling of core and decrease in radioactive heat sources
with time) is typically neglected. In our study, we use a 2D
finite volume code and apply a pseudo-plastic rheology. We
investigate how a strong pressure-dependence of the viscosity
influences not only the convective regime in the lower mantle,
but also in the upper mantle and hence the likelihood to obtain
plate tectonics. We examine how our results change when either
assuming a wet or a dry rheology or when employing different
initial conditions, focussing on the initial temperature in the
lower mantle and at the core-mantle boundary. We find that the
initial temperature conditions have a first-order influence on
the likelihood of plate tectonics on large exoplanets. For
standard literature values for initial temperatures of
super-Earths, surface mobilization is less likely than on Earth,
for warm initial temperature the result is vice versa.
Simulations that neglect the time-dependence of internal heat
sources on the other hand tend to lead to an increasing
likelihood of plate tectonics with increasing mass. Finally, our
investigations suggest that a wet rheology does not necessarily
favor plate tectonics, but -- depending on the reference
viscosity -- may rather lead to a stagnant-lid regime.",

author="Hamilton, Warren B",
abstract="Archean, Paleoproterozoic, and Mesoproterozoic rocks,
assemblages, and structures differ greatly both from each other
and from modern ones, and lack evidence for subduction and
seafloor spreading such as is widespread in Phanerozoic
terrains. Most specialists nevertheless apply non-actualistic
plate-tectonic explanations to the ancient terrains and do not
consider alternatives. This report evaluates popular concepts
with multidisciplinary information, and proposes options. The
key is fractionation by ca. 4.45 Ga of the hot young Earth into
core, severely depleted mantle, and thick mafic protocrust,
followed by still-continuing re-enrichment of upper mantle from
the top. This is opposite to the popular assumption that
silicate Earth is still slowly and unidirectionally
fractionating. The protocrust contained most material from which
all subsequent crust was derived, either directly, or indirectly
after downward recycling. Tonalite, trondhjemite, and
granodiorite (TTG), dominant components of Archean crust, were
derived mostly by partial melting of protocrust. Dense restitic
protocrust delaminated and sank into hot, weak dunite mantle,
which, displaced upward, enabled further partial melting of
protocrust. Sinkers enriched the upper mantle, in part
maintaining coherence as distinct dense rocks, and in part
yielding melts that metasomatized depleted-mantle dunite to more
pyroxenic and garnetiferous rocks. Not until ca. 3.6 Ga was TTG
crust cool enough to allow mafic and ultramafic lavas, from both
protocrust and re-enriched mantle, to erupt to the surface, and
then to sag as synclinal keels between rising diapiric
batholiths; simultaneously upper crust deformed ductily, then
brittly, above slowly flowing hot lower TTG crust.
Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic orogens appear to be
largely ensialic, developed from very thick basin-filling
sedimentary and volcanic rocks on thinned Archean or
Paleoproterozoic crust and remaining mafic protocrust, above
moderately re-enriched mantle. Subduction, and perhaps the
continent/ocean lithospheric dichotomy, began ca. 850 Ma --
although fully modern plate-tectonic processes began only in
Ordovician time -- and continued to enrich the cooling mantle in
excess of partial melts that contributed to new crust.

title="Mantle convection models featuring plate tectonic behavior: An
overview of methods and progress",
author="Lowman, Julian P",
abstract="Arguably, the presence of plate-tectonic-type surface motion for
periods that endure over hundreds of millions of years is the
primary feature a mantle convection model must possess in order
to be considered Earth-like. From the early days of mantle
dynamics modeling, research has been dedicated to understanding
how mantle convection produces the first order observations of
plate tectonics as well as how the plates and deep mantle
interact. Fledgling studies of the effect of plates on the mantle
recognized the ability of imposed plate-scale surface motion to
influence global temperatures and heat flux and organize
convective planform. Later studies featuring model plates with
dynamically determined velocities discovered that the interaction
between convection and the plates could result in cyclic plate
motion patterns and other time-dependent behavior that was not
manifested in systems in which dynamic plates were absent.
Focussing on different aspects of system realism (with respect to
terrestrial mantle convection) has spawned multiple approaches
for modeling convection with dynamic integrated plates. In
broadest terms, the two main approaches can be categorized as
rheological modeling methods and methods utilizing evolving
surface boundary conditions. Over the past dozen years, studies
focussing on the former approach have steadily made progress in
modeling the self-generation of plate tectonics from convection
dynamics. Continual advances have been encouraging, and a
consensus is beginning to form regarding the necessary
requirements for obtaining the primary elements of plate-like
surface motion. However, despite significant progress, the
generation of plates over long periods has not yet been modeled
with Earth-like convective vigor. In contrast, models utilizing
dynamically determined boundary conditions to achieve plate-like
surface motion have relatively little difficulty with emulating
terrestrial convective vigor or simulations of billions of years.
Instead, their weakness is more fundamental; they can only
provide insight into the reciprocating dynamics of the mantle and
plates once the existence of the plates is assumed and they
cannot model any aspects of the dynamics responsible for the
origin of the plates. This paper briefly reviews the evolution of
mantle convection models featuring plates and examines the
progress that has been made in our understanding of the feedback
between the mantle and plate tectonics through the use of both
rheological and boundary condition modeling methods. Common
findings, recent advances and unbridged problems are identified

continental crust, a combined U--Pb, Lu--Hf and O isotopic study

detrital zircon grains from the Niger, Nile, Congo, Zambezi and
Orange Rivers. The U--Pb isotopic data show age peaks at ca. 2.7,
2.1--1.8, 1.2--1.0, ca. 0.8, 0.7--0.5 and ca. 0.3 Ga. These
peaks, with the exception of the one at ca. 0.8 Ga, correspond
with the assembly of supercontinents. Furthermore, the detrital
zircons that crystallized during these periods of supercontinent
assembly have dominantly non-mantle-like O and Hf isotopic
signatures, in contrast to the ca. 0.8 Ga detrital zircons which
have juvenile characteristics. These data can be interpreted as
showing that continental collisions during supercontinent
assembly resulted in supermountain building accompanied by
remelting of older continental crust, which in turn led to
significant erosion of young igneous rocks with non-mantle-like
isotopic signatures. Alternatively, the data may indicate that
the major mode of crustal development changed during the
supercontinent cycle: the generation of juvenile crust in
extensional settings was dominant during supercontinent
fragmentation, whereas the stabilization of the generated crust
via crustal accretion and reworking was important during
supercontinent assembly. The Lu--Hf and O isotope systematics
indicate that terreigneous sediments could attain elevated
18O/16O via prolonged sediment--sediment recycling over long
crustal residence time, and also that reworking of carbonate and
chert which generally have elevated 18O/16O and low Hf contents
is minor in granitoid magmatism. The highest 18O/16O in detrital
zircon abruptly increased at ca. 2.1 Ga and became nearly
constant thereafter. This indicates that reworking of mature
sediments increased abruptly at that time, probably as a result
of a transition in the dynamics of either granitoid crust
formation or sedimentary evolution. To estimate the
mantle-extraction age of the reworked crust, we have calculated
arc mantle Hf model ages for the detrital zircons using O
isotopic data to constrain the Lu/Hf used in the model age
calculation. The Hf model age histograms for each period of
detrital zircons suggest that a significant amount of the African
continental crust was generated in the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic
likely by mafic magmatism, and subsequently reworked into younger
granitoid crust with varying crustal residence times.",

high degree of structural complexity and variability in
site-specific geometry and mass flux. The heterogeneity in the
structural evolution, the interior regime as well as external
architecture of individual margins is reflected in their seismic
character, resulting in a segmentation along-strike as well as
along-dip. Subduction zones generate more than 80\% of global
earthquakes above magnitude 8.0, but rupture characteristics are
highly individual and linked to margin specific geometrical
conditions. Major segments of subduction zones are commonly
submerged in deep water and difficult to access at the majority
of margins. Marine geophysical techniques, which are able to
image the complex structures in these settings with sufficient
coherency and depth penetration, have proven crucial to improve
our knowledge on the geological framework of the different types
of subduction zones. The aim of this review paper is to unravel
the structural diversity of convergent margins and between
individual subduction zone segments. Field data from different
margins around the globe deliver images of the seafloor and
subsurface in unprecedented resolution, which show segmentation
to be far more complex than previously inferred. Along-strike
segmentation results in accretionary segments contiguous to
erosive segments along a single margin. Modes of mass transfer
must hence be viewed as transient processes dependent on
sediment supply and lower plate structure. Along-strike segment
boundaries commonly correlate with underthrusting lower plate
relief that controls the deep deformation of a subduction zone
and the spatial and temporal variations in slip behavior.
Examples of underthrusting oceanic basement relief at different
stages of subduction elucidate their impact on the inner
geometry of the margin. Lower plate heterogeneities occur at
subduction zones worldwide and thus pose a common phenomenon,
whose role as barriers to seismic rupture constitute a central

abstract="Abstract Ocean plate stratigraphy (OPS) is a term used to
describe the sequence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks
deposited on oceanic crust substratum from the time it forms at
a spreading center, to the time it is incorporated into an
accretionary prism at a convergent margin. In this study, we
review the major geological characteristics of relict Cenozoic
to early Archean oceanic crust and OPS persevered in Alaska,
Japan, California (Franciscan Complex), Central Asia, British
Isles, Canada (Slave Province), Australia (Pilbara craton), and
Greenland (Isua and Ivisaartoq belts). An assessment of OPS in
accretionary orogens spanning the duration of Earth's rock
record shows remarkable similarities between OPS of all ages in
terms of structural style, major rock components, sequence of
accretion, and trace element geochemical signatures. Volcanic
rocks preserved in the orogenic belts are characterized
predominantly by oceanic island arc basalts, island arc
picrites, mid-ocean ridge basalts, back-arc basalts, oceanic
plateau basalts, ocean island basalts, and boninites, with
extremely rare komatiites. This demonstrates that sea-floor
spreading, lateral movement of oceanic plates with accompanying
sedimentation over the oceanic substratum, and accretion at
convergent margins have been major Earth processes since at
least 3.8 Ga ago. There have been some secular changes in the
rock types in OPS, such as changes in carbonates and radiolarian
cherts whose sources were in the biota in existence in
Phanerozoic times but absent in the Precambrian, but overall,
there have been few changes in the style of OPS accretion with
time. Komatiites and banded iron formations occur predominantly
in Archean orogenic belts, reflecting higher mantle temperatures
and less oxic seawater composition, respectively, before 2.5 Ga.
This is clear documentation that plate tectonics, including the
lateral movement of oceanic lithosphere, has been a major heat

abstract="Mars accumulated and differentiated into crust, mantle and core
within a few tens of millions of years of Solar System formation.
Formation of Hellas, which has been adopted as the base of the
Noachian period, is estimated to have occurred around 4.1 to 3.8
Gyr ago, depending on whether or not the planet experienced a
late cataclysm. Little is known of the pre-Noachian period except
that it was characterized by a magnetic field, subject to
numerous large basin-forming impacts, probably including one that
formed the global dichotomy. The Noachian period, which ended
around 3.7 Gyr ago, was characterized by high rates of cratering,
erosion, and valley formation. Most of Tharsis formed and surface
conditions were at least episodically such as to cause widespread
production of hydrous weathering products such as
phyllosilicates. Extensive sulfate deposits accumulated late in
the era. Average erosion rates, though high compared with later
epochs, fell short of the lowest average terrestrial rates. The
record suggests that warm, wet conditions necessary for fluvial
activity were met only occasionally, such as might occur if
caused by large impacts or volcanic eruptions. At the end of the
Noachian, rates of impact, valley formation, weathering, and
erosion all dropped precipitously but volcanism continued at a
relatively high average rate throughout the Hesperian, resulting
in the resurfacing of at least 30\% of the planet. Large water
floods formed episodically, possibly leaving behind large bodies
of water. The canyons formed. The observations suggest the change
at the end of the Noachian suppressed most aqueous activity at
the surface other than large floods, and resulted in growth of a
thick cryosphere. However, presence of discrete sulfate rich
deposits, sulfate concentrations in soils, and occasional
presence of Hesperian valley networks indicates that water
activity did not decline to zero. After the end of the Hesperian
around 3 Gyr ago the pace of geologic activity slowed further.
The average rate of volcanism during the Amazonian was
approximately a factor of ten lower than in the Hesperian and
activity was confined largely to Tharsis and Elysium. The main
era of water flooding was over, although small floods occurred
episodically until geologically recent times. Canyon development
was largely restricted to formation of large landslides. Erosion
and weathering rates remained extremely low. The most distinctive
characteristic of the Amazonian is formation of features that
have been attributed to the presence, accumulation, and movement
of ice. Included are the polar layered deposits, glacial deposits
on volcanoes, ice-rich veneers at high latitudes, and a variety
of landforms in the 30--55° latitude belts, including lobate
debris aprons, lineated valley fill and concentric crater fill.
Most of the gullies on steep slopes also formed late in this era.
The rate of formation of the ice-related features and the gullies
probably varied as changes in obliquity affected the ice

interpreted as times of enhanced preservation of the continental
crust associated with the assembly of supercontinents. An older
interpretation, which we support, is that they correspond instead
to periods of accelerated crustal growth related to episodic
convection of the mantle. In this paper we use fluid mechanics
experiments to develop a new model of mantle convection and
crustal growth. A dense layer at the base of the mantle persists
until 2.7 Ga when it destabilizes and generates large domes that
rise into the upper mantle. There they cause a large increase in
the rate of subduction which leads to enhanced granite magmatism
at convergent margins and thus to a pulse of crustal growth. The
domes heat the upper mantle which partially melts at mid-ocean
ridges to produce thick oceanic crust that resists subduction.
The subsequent period of subdued plate motion is broken by the
next generation of mantle domes. Before and after the

abstract="The earliest surface environment of the Earth is reconstructed in
accordance with the planetary formation theory. Formation of an
atmosphere is an inevitable consequence of Earth's formation. The
atmosphere near the close of accretion is composed of 200 ∼ 300
bars of H2 and H2O, and several tens of bars of CO and CO2.
Either by the blanketing effect of the proto-atmosphere or
heating by large planetesimal impacts a magma ocean is formed
during accretion. We can distinguish three stages for the thermal
evolution of the magma ocean and proto-crust. Stage 0 is
characterized by a super-liquidus (or completely molten) regime
near the surface. At this stage the surface of the Earth is
covered by a super-liquidus magma ocean. No chemical
differentiation is expected during this stage. Once the energy
flux released by planet formation decreases to the 200 W/m2 level
the super-liquidus magma ocean then disappears within a time
interval of 1 m.y. This is the transition from stage 0 to 1.
Stage 1 is characterized by a partially molten magma ocean. In
the magma ocean consisting of 20 ∼ 30\% partial melt, heat
transport is controlled by melt-solid separation (a type of
compositional convection) rather than thermal convection.
Chemical differentiation of the mantle mainly occurs in this
stage. Once the energy flux drops to the 160 W/m2 level, more
than 90\% of water vapor in the proto-atmosphere condense to form
the proto-oceans. Several tens of bars of CO and CO2 remain in
the atmosphere just after formation of the oceans. Water oceans
are occasionally evaporated by large impacts. After each such
event, recondensation of the ocean takes several hundred years.
Although the surface is covered by a chilled proto-crust, it is
short-lived because of extensive volcanic resurfacing activity as
well as meteorite impacts resurfacing. This stage ends when the
energy flux drops to 0.1 ∼ 1 W/m2 level. The duration time of
stage 1 is estimated to be several hundred million years (the
best estimate is about 400 m.y.). Stage 2 is characterized by
solid state convection. This stage continues to the present day.
One of the most important change on the proto-Earth is the
transition from stage 1 to 2, which occurs several hundred
million years after the Earth formation. Long-lived crust is
formed only after this transition.",

abstract="Abstract As the chronicle of plate motions through time,
paleogeography is fundamental to our understanding of plate
tectonics and its role in shaping the geology of the present-day.
To properly appreciate the history of tectonics---and its
influence on the deep Earth and climate---it is imperative to
seek an accurate and global model of paleogeography. However,
owing to the incessant loss of oceanic lithosphere through
subduction, the paleogeographic reconstruction of `full-plates'
(including oceanic lithosphere) becomes increasingly challenging
with age. Prior to 150 Ma ∼60\% of the lithosphere is missing and
reconstructions are developed without explicit regard for oceanic
lithosphere or plate tectonic principles; in effect, reflecting
the earlier mobilistic paradigm of continental drift. Although
these `continental' reconstructions have been immensely useful,
the next-generation of mantle models requires global plate
kinematic descriptions with full-plate reconstructions. Moreover,
in disregarding (or only loosely applying) plate tectonic rules,
continental reconstructions fail to take advantage of a wealth of
additional information in the form of practical constraints.
Following a series of new developments, both in geodynamic theory
and analytical tools, it is now feasible to construct full-plate
models that lend themselves to testing by the wider Earth-science
community. Such a model is presented here for the late Paleozoic
(410--250 Ma) together with a review of the underlying data.
Although we expect this model to be particularly useful for
numerical mantle modeling, we hope that it will also serve as a
general framework for understanding late Paleozoic tectonics, one
on which future improvements can be built and further tested.",

(QCDs) observed from high-resolution MOLA topography data. Their
presence has recently been interpreted to reflect a northern
lowlands that archive some of the earliest recorded rocks on
Mars, mostly below a veneer of Hesperian and Amazonian materials.
Here we analyze these data, coupled with a recent synthesis of
geologic, geophysical, geomorphic, topographic, and magnetic
information. Such analysis allows us to suggest a potential plate
tectonic phase during the recorded Early into Middle Noachian
martian history that transitioned into a monoplate world with
episodic magmatic-driven activity persisting to present. This
working hypothesis is based on: (1) the observation that the
basement of the northern plains is younger than the basement of
the southern highlands, but older than the material exposures of
the cratered highlands, suggesting different formational ages for
each one of the three geologic-time units; (2) the observation
that parts of the very ancient highland's crust are highly
magnetized, thus suggesting that most if not all of the formation
of the lowlands basement postdates the shut off of the martian
dynamo, some 4 Gyr ago, and so allowing hundreds of millions of
years for the shaping of the buried lowlands. Consequently, the
role of endogenic processes in the earliest geological evolution
of Mars (Early perhaps into Middle Noachian) requires
reconsideration, since MOLA topographic and MGS magnetic data
afford a temporal window sufficient for very early,
non-primordial shaping of the northern lowlands' basement.",

@article{Chambers2014-yg,
title="Giant planet formation with pebble accretion",
author="Chambers, J E",
abstract="Abstract In the core accretion model for giant planet formation,
a solid core forms by coagulation of dust grains in a
protoplanetary disk and then accretes gas from the disk when the
core reaches a critical mass. Both stages must be completed in a
few million years before the disk gas disperses. The slowest
stage of this process may be oligarchic growth in which a
giant-planet core grows by sweeping up smaller, asteroid-size
planetesimals. Here, we describe new numerical simulations of
oligarchic growth using a particle-in-a-box model. The
simulations include several processes that can effect oligarchic
growth: (i) planetesimal fragmentation due to mutual collisions,
(ii) the modified capture rate of planetesimals due to a core's
atmosphere, (iii) drag with the disk gas during encounters with
the core (so-called ``pebble accretion''), (iv) modification of
particle velocities by turbulence and drift caused by gas drag,
(v) the presence of a population of mm-to-m size ``pebbles'' that
represent the transition point between disruptive collisions
between larger particles, and mergers between dust grains, and
(vi) radial drift of small objects due to gas drag. Collisions
between planetesimals rapidly generate a population of pebbles.
The rate at which a core sweeps up pebbles is controlled by
pebble accretion dynamics. Metre-size pebbles lose energy during
an encounter with a core due to drag, and settle towards the
core, greatly increasing the capture probability during a single
encounter. Millimetre-size pebbles are tightly coupled to the gas
and most are swept past the core during an encounter rather than
being captured. Accretion efficiency per encounter increases with
pebble size in this size range. However, radial drift rates also
increase with size, so metre-size objects encounter a core on
many fewer occasions than mm-size pebbles before they drift out
of a region. The net result is that core growth rates vary weakly
with pebble size, with the optimal diameter being about 10 cm.
The main effect of planetesimal size is to determine the rate of
mutual collisions, fragment production and the formation of
pebbles. 1-km-diameter planetesimals collide frequently and have
low impact strengths, leading to a large surface density of
pebbles and rapid core growth via pebble accretion.
100-km-diameter planetesimals produce fewer pebbles, and pebble
accretion plays a minor role in this case. The strength of
turbulence in the gas determines the scale height of pebbles in
the disk, which affects the rate at which they are accreted. For
an initial solid surface density of 12 g/cm2 at 5 AU, with 10-cm
diameter pebbles and a disk viscosity parameter $\alpha$ = 10 - 4
, a 10-Earth mass core can form in 3 My for 1--10 km diameter
planetesimals. The growth of such a core requires longer than 3
My if planetesimals are 100 km in diameter.",

abstract="Granulite facies ultrahigh temperature metamorphism (G-UHTM) is
documented in the rock record predominantly from Neoarchean to
Cambrian; G-UHTM facies series rocks may be inferred at depth in
younger, particularly Cenozoic orogenic systems. The first
occurrence of G-UHTM in the rock record signifies a change in
geodynamics that generated transient sites of very high heat
flow. Many G-UHTM belts may have developed in settings analogous
to modern continental backarcs. On a warmer Earth, the cyclic
formation of supercontinents and their breakup, particularly by
extroversion, which involved destruction of ocean basins floored
by thinner lithosphere, may have generated hotter continental
backarcs than those associated with the modern Pacific rim.
Medium-temperature eclogite, high-pressure granulite metamorphism
(E-HPGM), is also first recognized in the Neoarchean rock record
and occurs at intervals throughout the Proterozoic and Paleozoic
rock record. E-HPGM belts are complementary to G-UHTM belts and
are generally inferred to record subduction-to-collision
orogenesis. Blueschists become evident in the Neoproterozoic rock
record; they record the low thermal gradients associated with
modern subduction. Lawsonite blueschists and eclogites
(high-pressure metamorphism, HPM) and ultrahigh pressure
metamorphism (UHPM) characterized by coesite ($\pm$lawsonite) or
diamond are predominantly Phanerozoic phenomena. HPM-UHPM
registers the low thermal gradients and deep subduction of
continental crust during the early stage of the collision process
in Phanerozoic subduction-to-collision orogens. Although perhaps
counterintuitive, many HPM-UHPM belts appear to have developed by
closure of small ocean basins in the process of accretion of a
continental terrane during a period of supercontinent
introversion (Wilson cycle ocean basin opening and closing). A
duality of metamorphic belts---reflecting a duality of thermal
regimes---appears in the record only since the Neoarchean Era. A
duality of thermal regimes is the hallmark of modern plate
tectonics and the duality of metamorphic belts is the
characteristic imprint of plate tectonics in the rock record. The
occurrence of both G-UHTM and E-HPGM belts since the Neoarchean
manifests the onset of a `Proterozoic plate tectonics regime',
although the style of tectonics likely involved differences. The
`Proterozoic plate tectonics regime' evolved during a
Neoproterozoic transition to the `modern plate tectonics regime'
characterized by colder subduction and subduction of continental
crust deep into the mantle and its (partial) return from depths
of up to 300 km, as chronicled by the appearance of HPM-UHPM in
the rock record. The age distribution of metamorphic belts that
record extreme conditions of metamorphism is not uniform, and
metamorphism occurs in periods that correspond to amalgamation of
continental lithosphere into supercratons (e.g. Superia/Sclavia)

abstract="Cratonisation is regarded as coincident with amalgamation and
lithosphere thickening during collisional tectonics, leading to
the birth of the cratonic entities we know today. These are,
however, themselves rifted remnants of earlier plate
configurations involving cratonic nuclei whose mode of formation
conditioned their properties, hence stability and further
evolution. Dating of inclusions in diamonds reveals that some
thick cratonic roots existed well in advance of accretionary
processes leading to craton amalgamation or reflected in the ages
of eclogites residing in cratonic mantle. Major uncertainties
relate to (1) whether these nuclei formed at ambient or excess
mantle potential temperatures TP, i.e. in mid-ocean ridge or
oceanic plateau settings and (2) whether the deep, garnet-bearing
cratonic mantle, a portion of which extends into the diamond
stability field (> 150 km), formed by plume subcretion or
stacking of oceanic lithosphere. In order to extract constraints
from published data sets that include samples modified by mantle
metasomatism, olivine inclusions in diamonds are used as a guide
to the pre-metasomatic composition of the cratonic subcontinental
lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The FeO--MgO relationships of the
filtered data set show that many depleted cratonic SCLM sections
nucleated by onset of partial melting at pressures > 5 GPa,
possibly pointing to formation at excess TP typical of plumes,
rather than at ambient TP in Archaean mid-ocean ridge settings.
Cr2O3--Al2O3 relationships constrain pressures of equilibrium
partial melt extraction. All cratonic depleted garnet peridotite
suites have compositions consistent with formation at pressures
$\geq$ 3 GPa and hence formed in situ and not by subduction of
oceanic plates. Because most cratonic SCLM sections formed as
high-pressure residues consisting of olivine and aluminous
orthopyroxene, the absence of a garnet signature in residual
peridotites that last equilibrated at pressures > 3 GPa is not
proof for original partial melting in the spinel stability field.
Cratonic crust may have formed by shallow plate interactions
leading to generation of TTGs and greenstone belts. These crustal
nuclei may have been subsequently penetrated and subcreted by
plume-derived melts, and, after delamination of dense eclogite
and komatiites, were trapped by buoyant plume residues. This
ensured craton longevity and implies that cratonic crust and

episodic models for continental growth, a large number of
geochemical and geophysical observations can be explained with
these models. The models have in common episodic collapse of
subducted slabs through the 660 km seismic discontinuity, mantle
convection changing from layered to whole mantle, and each
collapse correlates with major episodes of crustal formation.
Isotopic age distributions of juvenile continental crust suggest
that crustal formation episodes at 2.7, 1.9, and 1.2 Ga may have
been very short, each $\leq$100 My in length. The supercontinent
cycle probably operates independently of slab avalanches at the
660 km seismic discontinuity, except for the first supercontinent
at 2.7 Ga, which may have formed in response to the first slab
avalanche. The production rate of continental crust may increase
during slab avalanches in response to increased production rate
of oceanic plateaus and of subduction-related crust. Crustal
recycling rate may drop significantly below crustal production
rate during slab avalanches due to the formation of
supercontinents, which trap juvenile crust. If supercontinents
are responsible for the preservation of large amounts of juvenile
continental crust, then they play an important role in the growth
of continental crust with time. During each of three superevents

Estimates of local isostatic equilibration and potential energy,

understanding of how and why continental topography is developed.
We employ several simplifying assumptions about the crustal and
mantle lithosphere density and structure (and readily acknowledge
that our results are therefore first-order approximations) to
predict the pre-orogenic structure of the lithosphere. At the
outset we emphasize that while this approach does not provide an
exhaustive evaluation of the deformation mechanism, it does serve
to quantify the relative role played by the variations in the
crustal and upper mantle components of the lithosphere. In this
way we are able to use independent measurement of lithospheric
geoid anomalies, current (post-orogenic) elevation and
lithospheric structure, and paleoelevation information to
estimate topographic development and structural support over
time. Application of this technique to the southwestern United

that the lithosphere of the pre-orogenic Southern Basin and Range

abstract="The dynamics of a planet and its evolution are controlled to a
large extent by its viscosity. In this study, we demonstrate that
the dependence of mantle viscosity on temperature and water
concentration introduces strong dynamic feedbacks. We derive a
dimensionless parameter to quantitatively evaluate the relative
strength of those feedbacks, and show that water and heat
transport are equally important in controlling present-day
dynamics for the Earth. A simple parameterized evolution model
illustrates the strong feedbacks and behavior of the system and
agrees well with our analytic results. The analysis identifies
characteristic times for changes of viscosity, temperature, and
water concentration and demonstrates, for time scales greater
than a few hundred million years, that the system should either
be degassing while warming or regassing while cooling. This
yields a characteristic evolution in which, after an initial
period of rapid adjustment, the mantle warms while degassing, and
subsequently cools rapidly while regassing. As the planet
continues to cool, the entire surface ocean may eventually return
to the mantle. Our results suggest that a simple relationship may
exist between the rate of change of water concentration and the
rate of change of temperature in the mantle. This connection is
extended by deriving an explicit equation for the Urey ratio that
depends on both heat and water transport.",

Hf-isotope data",

abstract="A worldwide database of over 13,800 integrated U--Pb and
Hf-isotope analyses of zircon, derived largely from detrital
sources, has been used to examine processes of crustal evolution
on a global scale, and to test existing models for the growth of
continental crust through time. In this study we introduce a new
approach to quantitatively estimating the proportion of juvenile
material added to the crust at any given time during its
evolution. This estimate is then used to model the crustal growth
rate over the 4.56 Ga of Earth's history. The modelling suggests
that there was little episodicity in the production of new crust,
as opposed to peaks in magmatic ages. The distribution of age-Hf
isotope data from zircons worldwide implies that at least 60\% of
the existing continental crust separated from the mantle before
2.5 Ga. However, taking into consideration new evidence coming
from geophysical data, the formation of most continental crust
early in Earth's history (at least 70\% before 2.5 Ga) is even
more probable. Thus, crustal reworking has dominated over net
juvenile additions to the continental crust, at least since the
end of the Archean. Moreover, the juvenile proportion of newly
formed crust decreases stepwise through time: it is about 70\% in
the 4.0--2.2 Ga time interval, about 50\% in the 1.8--0.6 Ga time
interval, and possibly less than 50\% after 0.6 Ga. These changes
may be related to the formation of supercontinents.",

abstract="Continental crustal growth rates, crustal volumes/thicknesses,
and continental freeboard are considered to be intimately
related; however none are easy to quantify, least of all in the
Precambrian. Additionally, crustal volumes/thicknesses and
isostasy are related to changing mantle heat and the concomitant
variation in thickness of ocean crust. Another set of variables
would be the interaction of plate tectonics (and the onset of
plate tectonics, a contentious issue in itself) and mantle
plumes/superplumes. Further complication is provided by the
ranges of freeboard elevations and eustatic sea level changes
overlapping in scale, and sharing common genetic causes. The
``constant freeboard model'' suggests that the net results of the
interaction of this complex set of variables has been that
continental elevation relative to sea level, has remained
essentially similar, on a global average basis, over much of
geological time, assuming an essentially constant ocean volume
since c. 3.8 Ga. Application of this model to the Precambrian
geological record suggests that sigmoidal crustal growth rate
models are probably the most reliable. A conundrum of the
constant freeboard model would be that freeboard would tend to
become lowered towards mean sea level for any specific craton
over time; this ``freeboard-equilibrium'' would be interrupted
for a particular craton by active geodynamic processes resulting
from the interplay of plate tectonics and mantle thermal
instabilities. In this paper we test the validity of this thesis
of alternating approximate freeboard-equilibrium and active
geodynamics, by examining the volcano-sedimentary record of a
number of cratons: Kaapvaal, Singhbhum and Pilbara. For the
Singhbhum craton (and bearing in mind its poor chronological data
base), freeboard-equilibrium appears to have prevailed until c.
2.1 Ga, but for Kaapvaal and Pilbara, until c. 1.8 Ga, the
geodynamic processes largely outweighed the tendency towards
equilibrium, except for c. 200 My from c. 2.6 to 2.4 Ga when
global sea level appears to have remained high and transgression
was the norm. We thus tentatively add the plate tectonic cycle

within the crustal column was found to play a significant role in
determining the local thermal structure of the continental

crust lead to a thinner thermal lithosphere. Mantle heat flux
into the base of stable continents was low relative to surface
heat flux and did not vary significantly within the simulations
regardless of the presence or absence of a thick cratonic root. A
suite of simulations with variable root thickness indicated that
although cratonic roots have a weak effect on surface heat flow
patterns, relative to crustal heat source variations, they do
have a pronounced effect on deeper thermal structure. Roots
stabilized temporal variations of deep continental geotherms and
were required to generate a thick thermal lithosphere. The ratio

the geologic record",

abstract="Simultaneous supercontinent and superplume events may reinforce
or cancel signals preserved in the geologic record.
Alternatively, one signal may overwhelm the other. For instance,
relatively low sea level during a 2.7-Ga
superplume/supercontinent event may reflect direct hits of
superplumes beneath the supercontinent. Although both
supercontinent formation and superplume events occurred at 0.28,
1.9 and 2.7 Ga, global warming at these times indicates the
dominance of superplume events in controlling climate. Enhanced
deposition of black shales correlates with superplume events and
with supercontinent breakup. Carbon isotopes in seawater,
however, show positive excursions during supercontinent breakup
at 2.2--2.1 and 0.8--0.6 Ga, but show mixed signals or no signal
during other supercontinent or superplume events, probably due to
negative feedbacks. Peaks in marine organism originations at 100,
280, and 480 Ma correlate with possible superplume events,
whereas an overall decrease in origination rate in the early
Paleozoic correlates with the growth of Pangea and destruction of
shallow marine environments. Increased production rates of
juvenile crust correlate with formation of supercontinents and
with superplume events. There may be two types of superplume
events: catastrophic events, which are short-lived (<100 My) and
shielding events, which are long-lived ($\geq$200 My).
Catastrophic events may be triggered by slab avalanches in the
mantle and may be responsible for episodic crustal growth.
Shielding superplume events, caused by shielding of the mantle
from subduction by supercontinents, are responsible for
relatively small additions of mafic components to the continents

abstract="Abstract A major change in Earth's geodynamics occurred ~3
billion years (Ga) ago, likely related to the onset of modern and
continuous plate tectonics. However, the question of how Earth
functioned prior to this time is poorly constrained. Here, we
find a resolvable positive 142Nd anomaly in a 2.7 Ga old
tholeiitic lava flow from the Abitibi Greenstone Belt indicating
that early-formed mantle heterogeneities persisted at least 1.8
Ga after Earth's formation. This result contradicts the expected
rapid early (~0.1 Ga), as well as the slower present-day (~1 Ga)
mixing rates in the convecting mantle. Using a numerical modeling
approach, we show that convective mixing is inefficient in
absence of mobile-lid plate tectonics. The preservation of a
142Nd anomaly until 2.7 Ga ago can be explained if throughout the
Hadean and Archean, Earth was characterized by a stagnant-lid
regime, possibly with sporadic and short subduction episodes. The
major change in geodynamics observed around ~3 Ga ago can then
reflect the transition from stagnant-lid plate tectonics to
modern mobile-lid plate tectonics. Solving the paradox of a

title="Divergent evolution of Earth and Venus: Influence of degassing,
tectonics, and magnetic fields",
author="Driscoll, P and Bercovici, D",
abstract="Abstract Knowledge of the earliest evolution of Earth and Venus
is extremely limited, but it is obvious from their dramatic
contrasts today that at some point in their evolution conditions
on the two planets diverged. In this paper we develop a
geophysical systems box model that simulates the flux of carbon
through the mantle, atmosphere, ocean, and seafloor, and the
degassing of water from the mantle. Volatile fluxes, including
loss to space, are functions of local volatile concentration,
degassing efficiency, tectonic plate speed, and magnetic field
intensity. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the
equilibration to a steady state carbon cycle, where carbon and
water are distributed among mantle, atmosphere, ocean, and
crustal reservoirs, similar to present-day Earth. These stable
models reach steady state after several hundred million years by
maintaining a negative feedback between atmospheric temperature,
carbon dioxide weathering, and surface tectonics. At the orbit of
Venus, an otherwise similar model evolves to a runaway greenhouse
with all volatiles in the atmosphere. The influence of magnetic
field intensity on atmospheric escape is demonstrated in Venus
models where either a strong magnetic field helps the atmosphere
to retain about 60 bars of water vapor after 4.5 Gyr, or the lack
of a magnetic field allows for the loss of all atmospheric water
to space in about 1 Gyr. The relative influences of plate speed
and degassing rate on the weathering rate and greenhouse
stability are demonstrated, and a stable to runaway regime
diagram is presented. In conclusion, we propose that a stable
climate-tectonic-carbon cycle is part of a larger coupled
geophysical system where a moderate surface climate provides a
stabilizing feedback for maintaining surface tectonics, the
thermal cooling of the deep interior, magnetic field generation,
and the shielding of the atmosphere over billion year time

title="Generation of plate tectonics from lithosphere--mantle flow and
void--volatile self-lubrication",
author="Bercovici, David",
abstract="The formation of plate tectonics from mantle convection
necessarily requires nonlinear rheological behavior. Recent
studies suggest that self-lubricating rheological mechanisms are
most capable of generating plate-like motion out of fluid flows.
The basic paradigm of self-lubrication is nominally derived from
the feedback between viscous heating and temperature-dependent
viscosity. Here, we propose a new idealized self-lubrication
mechanism based on void (e.g., pore and/or microcrack) generation
and volatile (e.g., water) ingestion. We test this void--volatile
self-lubrication mechanism in a source--sink flow model; this
leads to a basic nonlinear system which permits the excitation of
strike--slip (toroidal) motion (a necessary ingredient of
plate-like motion) out of purely divergent (i.e., poloidal or
characteristically convective) flow. With relatively inviscid
void-filling volatiles, the void--volatile mechanism yields a
state of highly plate-like motion (i.e., with uniformly strong
``plate'' interiors, weak margins, and extremely focussed
strike--slip shear zones). Moreover, the void--volatile model
obeys a chemical diffusion time scale that is typically much
longer than the thermal convection time scale; the model thus
complies with the observation that plate boundaries are long
lived and survive even while inactive. The void--volatile model
of self-lubrication therefore predicts self-focussing shear
zones, plate generation, and plate-boundary longevity through
what has long been suspected to be a key ingredient for the
existence of plate tectonics, i.e., water.",

Yff, Jessica A and Jaeger, Windy L and Schenk, Paul M and
Geissler, Paul E and Becker, Tammy L",
abstract="We produced the first complete, 1:15 M-scale global geologic map
of Jupiter's moon Io, based on a set of monochrome and color
Galileo--Voyager image mosaics produced at a spatial resolution
of 1 km/pixel. The surface of Io was mapped into 19 units based
on albedo, color and surface morphology, and is subdivided as
follows: plains (65.8\% of surface), lava flow fields (28.5\%),
mountains (3.2\%), and patera floors (2.5\%). Diffuse deposits
(DD) that mantle the other units cover ∼18\% of Io's surface, and
are distributed as follows: red (8.6\% of surface), white
(6.9\%), yellow (2.1\%), black (0.6\%), and green (∼0.01\%).
Analyses of the geographical and areal distribution of these
units yield a number of results, summarized below. (1) The
distribution of plains units of different colors is generally
geographically constrained: Red--brown plains occur >$\pm$30°
latitude, and are thought to result from enhanced alteration of
other units induced by radiation coming in from the poles. White
plains (possibly dominated by SO2 + contaminants) occur mostly in
the equatorial antijovian region ($\pm$30°, 90--230°W), possibly
indicative of a regional cold trap. Outliers of white, yellow,
and red--brown plains in other regions may result from long-term
accumulation of white, yellow, and red diffuse deposits,
respectively. (2) Bright (possibly sulfur-rich) flow fields make
up 30\% more lava flow fields than dark (presumably silicate)
flows (56.5\% vs. 43.5\%), and only 18\% of bright flow fields
occur within 10 km of dark flow fields. These results suggest
that secondary sulfurous volcanism (where a bright-dark
association is expected) could be responsible for only a fraction
of Io's recent bright flows, and that primary sulfur-rich
effusions could be an important component of Io's recent
volcanism. An unusual concentration of bright flows at ∼45--75°N,
∼60--120°W could be indicative of more extensive primary
sulfurous volcanism in the recent past. However, it remains
unclear whether most bright flows are bright because they are
sulfur flows, or because they are cold silicate flows covered in
sulfur-rich particles from plume fallout. (3) We mapped 425
paterae (volcano-tectonic depressions), up from 417 previously
identified by Radebaugh et al. (Radebaugh, J., Keszthelyi, L.P.,
McEwen, A.S., Turtle, E.P., Jaeger, W., Milazzo, M. [2001]. J.
Geophys. Res. 106, 33005--33020). Although these features cover
only 2.5\% of Io's surface, they correspond to 64\% of all
detected hot spots; 45\% of all hot spots are associated with the
freshest dark patera floors, reflecting the importance of active
silicate volcanism to Io's heat flow. (4) Mountains cover only
∼3\% of the surface, although the transition from mountains to
plains is gradational with the available imagery. 49\% of all
mountains are lineated and presumably layered, showing evidence
of linear structures supportive of a tectonic origin. In
contrast, only 6\% of visible mountains are mottled (showing
hummocks indicative of mass wasting) and 4\% are tholi (domes or
shields), consistent with a volcanic origin. (5) Initial analyses
of the geographic distributions of map units show no significant
longitudinal variation in the quantity of Io's mountains or
paterae, in contrast to earlier studies. This is because we use
the area of mountain and patera materials as opposed to the
number of structures, and our result suggests that the previously
proposed anti-correlation of mountains and paterae (Schenk, P.,
Hargitai, H., Wilson, R., McEwen, A., Thomas, P. [2001]. J.
Geophys. Res. 106, 33201--33222; Kirchoff, M.R., McKinnon, W.B.,
Schenk, P.M. [2011]. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 301, 22--30) is
more complex than previously thought. There is also a slight
decrease in surface area of lava flows toward the poles of Io,
perhaps indicative of variations in volcanic activity. (6) The
freshest bright and dark flows make up about 29\% of all of Io's
flow fields, suggesting active emplacement is occurring in less
than a third of Io's visible lava fields. (7) About 47\% of Io's
diffuse deposits (by area) are red, presumably deriving their
color from condensed sulfur gas, and ∼38\% are white, presumably
dominated by condensed SO2. The much greater areal extent of
gas-derived diffuse deposits (red + white, 85\%) compared to
presumably pyroclast-bearing diffuse deposits (dark (silicate
tephra) + yellow (sulfur-rich tephra), 15\%) indicates that there
is effective separation between the transport of tephra and gas
in many Ionian explosive eruptions. Future improvements in the
geologic mapping of Io can be obtained via (a) investigating the
relationships between different color/material units that are
geographically and temporally associated, (b) better analysis of
the temporal variations in the map units, and (c) additional
high-resolution images (spatial resolutions ∼200 m/pixel or
better). These improvements would be greatly facilitated by new
data, which could be obtained by future missions.",

abstract="Thus far, relatively simplistic models of free subduction, in
which the trench and plate motions are emergent features
completely driven by the negative buoyancy of the slab, have
investigated the dynamics of a single, isolated subducting plate.
Here we extend such models to incorporate an overriding plate and
present the results of how such an overriding plate feedbacks
into the dynamics of free subduction. In this study, we address
three fundamental aspects of these dynamics: 1) How does the
presence of an overriding plate change the force balance at the
convergent margins? 2) How are the forces from deep subduction
propagated to the surface? And 3) what controls the stress regime
in a system of coupled upper and subducting plates and how is it
expressed in the deformations and plate motions? In general, we
find that the evolution of subduction zones is strongly
controlled by both the interactions between the slab and the
upper-lower mantle discontinuity as well as the strength of the
upper plate. When either the subducting or upper plates are
unable to move, subduction motions are steady state and
partitioned entirely into either slab rollback or plate advance,
respectively. When conditions favour a quasi-stationary trench,
the subducted lithosphere can form into a pile with multiple
recumbent folds of slab material atop the lower mantle.
Alternating between forwards- and backwards-draping slab, the
corresponding horizontal trench motions at the surface are
frontward and rearward, respectively, resulting in either a
compressive or extensional regime in the back-arc. Time-dependent
forcing arising from the slab piling behaviour can have a
feedback with upper plate and produce strongly non-steady state,
intermittent phases of upper plate deformation as those commonly
observed on Earth. Two types of discontinuous back-arc strain
evolution are identified: (1) periodic, when recurrent phases of
strain over finite durations are accommodated by (viscous)
stretching/thickening of the plate, and (2) episodic, when upper
plate deformation localizes (plastic strain) and allows for
punctuated episodes. These phases can include extension,
quiescence, and compression, giving rise to a large variety of
possible tectonic evolutions. The models presented here provide
insight into the dynamics behind the non-steady-state evolution
of subduction, which can help unravel seemingly erratic motions
of major convergent margins and back-arc deformations around the
Pacific and Indian Oceans during the Cenozoic.",

abstract="Because of the strongly different conditions in the mantle of the
early Earth regarding temperature and viscosity, present-day
geodynamics cannot simply be extrapolated back to the early
history of the Earth. We use numerical thermochemical convection
models including partial melting and a simple mechanism for melt
segregation and oceanic crust production to investigate an
alternative suite of dynamics which may have been in operation in
the early Earth. Our modelling results show three processes that
may have played an important role in the production and recycling
of oceanic crust: (1) Small-scale (x$\times$100 km) convection
involving the lower crust and shallow upper mantle. Partial
melting and thus crustal production takes place in the upwelling
limb and delamination of the eclogitic lower crust in the
downwelling limb. (2) Large-scale resurfacing events in which
(nearly) the complete crust sinks into the (eventually lower)
mantle, thereby forming a stable reservoir enriched in
incompatible elements in the deep mantle. New crust is
simultaneously formed at the surface from segregating melt. (3)
Intrusion of lower mantle diapirs with a high excess temperature
(about 250 K) into the upper mantle, causing massive melting and
crustal growth. This allows for plumes in the Archean upper
mantle with a much higher excess temperature than previously
expected from theoretical considerations.",

title="Structural control on magmatism along divergent and convergent
plate boundaries: Overview, model, problems",
author="Acocella, Valerio",
abstract="Abstract Plate boundaries are the most active, unstable and
hazardous areas on Earth. The aim of this study is twofold.1)
Provide an overview of the main structural features along
divergent and convergent plate boundaries and their relationships
to volcanism. The considered divergent plate boundaries include
the continental East African Rift System (EARS), the transitional
Afar Rifts and slow (Iceland) and fast (East Pacific Rise)
oceanic ridges. The analysis of the convergent plate boundaries
refers to the extensional (Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand),
strike-slip (Sumatra), contractional (NE Japan) and more complex
(Central Andes) volcanic arcs. 2) Propose an original and
innovative frame to understand tectono-magmatic processes along
plate boundaries, based on two major points. a) Magmatism may
effectively control the development of plate boundaries. At
immature continental divergent plate boundaries (as the
non-magmatic portions of the EARS), regional extension plays a
major role in extending the upper crust; however, along mature
continental and oceanic rifts magmatism is most effective in
spreading plates apart through dikes. At convergent plate
boundaries, the possibility to develop extensional, strike-slip,
contractional and oblique systems along the volcanic arc provides
highly variable structural conditions controlling magmatism. At
least three magmatic processes (diking, sill emplacement,
heat-induced strain localization) may control the development of
volcanic arcs. In addition, megathrust earthquakes may induce
transient extension, enhancing volcanism. Therefore, the
evolution of both divergent and convergent plate boundaries is
significantly magma-controlled and magmatic processes seem
largely self-sustained, requiring limited direct tectonic
contribution; and b) magmatism along divergent and convergent
plate boundaries usually focuses in magmatic systems, associated
with a dominant volcano. Magmatic systems provide a convenient
framework to relate the geometric and compositional features of a
magmatic plate boundary to its tectonic setting. In particular,
the larger the opening rate, the lower is the aspect ratio A (A =
width W/length L) of the magmatic system. Therefore, the linear
magmatic accretion of divergent plate boundaries and extensional
arcs is replaced by a punctiform accretion in contractional arcs.
Several aspects (magmatic rates, lateral vs. vertical dike
propagation along divergent plate boundaries, structural control
on volcanism along strike-slip arcs) are still poorly defined and
should be the target of future research.",

abstract="Analysis of the tectonostratigraphic records of Late Archean to
Early Paleoproterozoic terranes indicates linkage between global
tectonics, changing sea levels and environmental conditions. A
Late Archean tectonic cycle started at ∼2.78 Ga involving the
breakup of a pre-existing continent (Vaalbara) and the most
prodigious period of generation and preservation of juvenile
continental crust recorded in Earth history during a period of
plume breakout (∼2.72 to 2.65 Ga) accompanied by high sea levels.
During this period, cratons formed by accretion of
granitoid--greenstone terranes at convergent margins started to
aggregate into larger continents (e.g. Kenorland). Lower sea
levels between ∼2.65 and 2.55 Ga were followed by a second (∼2.51
to 2.45 Ga) period of plume breakout resulting in a global peak
in magmatism, high sea levels and deposition of banded iron
formations (BIF) on the trailing margins of the Pilbara and
Kaapvaal cratons. Cratons in South Australia, Antarctica, India,
and China record convergent margin magmatism, orogeny and
high-grade metamorphism between 2.56 and 2.42 Ga. Continued
aggregation of continental fragments (e.g. amalgamation of Indian
cratons) may have formed the Earth's first supercontinent by ∼2.4
Ga with a return to low sea levels and relative tectonic
quiescence before the supercontinent started to breakup from
∼2.32 Ga. Although oxygenic photosynthesis had evolved by 2.71
Ga, the irreversible rise of atmospheric O2 to > 10− 5 PAL
appears to have occurred between 2.47 and 2.40 Ga following the
second plume breakout and coinciding with a decline in BIF
deposition and the maximum extent of the supercontinent
suggesting dynamic linkage between tectonics and both the sources
and sinks of oxygen. Periods of plume breakout (2.72 to 2.65 Ga
and 2.51 to 2.45 Ga) would have limited ocean productivity and
the rate of photosynthesis and also enhanced the reduced
conditions typical of the Archean biosphere, as well as the
greenhouse gas contents of the atmosphere necessary to maintain
temperate conditions. This suggests that either an increase in
the oxidation state of volcanic gasses during the second plume
breakout, or a decreased flux of reduced gasses following plume
breakout, coupled with the filling of crustal oxygen sinks and
possibly also an increase in ocean productivity and the rate of
photosynthesis resulted in the global flux of reduced gasses
falling below oxygen production leading to a rise of atmospheric
O2 accompanied by loss of the CH4-rich greenhouse atmosphere
resulting in the Earth's first widespread glaciation. Detrital
pyrite and uraninite in 2.45 to 2.40 Ga sediments suggests that
terrestrial surface environments were not yet extensively
oxidized. The oldest evidence of extensive oxidative weathering
is associated with 2.32 to 2.22 Ga glacial deposits and breakup
of the supercontinent.",

such materials existed as lithosphere in the near-surface Hadean

massive heat transfer necessitated vigorous crust--mantle

convection, including voluminous plume ascent, efficiently rid
the planet of heat, but lessened over time. Plate thickening and
broadening is reflected in the post-Hadean rock record. Stages of

mush ocean overturn and ephemeral lithospheric platelets; (b)
4.4--2.7Ga, growth of oceanic and diminutive continental plates,

title="On the thermal and magnetic histories of Earth and Venus:
Influences of melting, radioactivity, and conductivity",
author="Driscoll, P and Bercovici, D",
abstract="Abstract The study of the thermal evolution of Earth's interior
is uncertain and controversial in many respects, from the
interpretation of petrologic observations used to infer the
temperature and dynamics of the interior, to the physics and
material properties governing heat transport. The thermal history
of Venus is even more uncertain, but the lack of a dynamo at
present in an otherwise similar planet may provide additional
constraints on terrestrial planet evolution. In this paper a one
dimensional thermal history model is derived that includes heat
loss due to mantle melt eruption at the surface to explore its
influence on the thermal and magnetic history of Earth and Venus.
We show that the thermal catastrophe of Earth's mantle, which
occurs for a present day Urey ratio of 1/3 and convective heat
loss exponent of $\beta$ = 1 / 3 , can be avoided by assuming a
rather high core heat flow of ∼15 TW. This core heat flow also
avoids the new core paradox by allowing for the geodynamo to be
thermally powered prior to inner core growth for core thermal
conductivities as high as 130 Wm - 1 K - 1 . Dynamo regime
diagrams demonstrate that the mantle melt eruption rate has a
minor effect on the history of mobile lid planets due to the
efficiency of plate tectonic convective heat loss. However, if
Earth were in a stagnant lid regime prior to 2.5 Ga, as has been
proposed, then at least ∼5\% of mantle melt is required to erupt
in order to thermally power the paleodynamo at that time. Dynamo
regime diagrams for stagnant lid Venus models indicate that more
than half of the melt generated in the mantle is required to
erupt in order to overcome the insulation imposed by the stagnant
lid and drive a dynamo. This implies that with an Earth-like
mantle radioactivity the Venusian dynamo shut down ∼0.3 Ga for an
eruption efficiency of 50 \% , and ∼3 Ga for an eruption
efficiency of zero. Consequently, a stagnant lid alone does not
prevent a core dynamo if melting of the upper mantle provides a
substantial mantle heat sink.",

abstract="Abstract For 50 years of data collection and kinematic
reconstruction efforts, plate models have provided alternative
scenarios for plate motions and seafloor spreading for the past
200 My. However, these efforts are naturally limited by the
incomplete preservation of very old seafloor, and therefore the
time-dependence of the production of new seafloor is
controversial. There is no consensus on how much it has varied in
the past 200 My, and how it could have fluctuated over longer
timescales. We explore how seafloor spreading and continental
drift evolve over long geological periods using independently
derived models: a recently developed geodynamic modelling
approach and state-of-the-art plate reconstructions. Both
kinematic reconstructions and geodynamic models converge on
variations by a factor of 2 in the rate of production of new
seafloor over a Wilson cycle, with concomitant changes of the
shape of the area--age distribution of the seafloor between end
members of rectangular, triangular and skewed distributions.
Convection models show that significant fluctuations over longer
periods (∼1 Gy) should exist, involving changes in ridge length
and global tectonic reorganisations. Although independent, both
convection models and kinematic reconstructions suggest that
changes in ridge length are at least as significant as spreading
rate fluctuations in driving changes in the seafloor area--age

red planet at medium to low resolution (2--4 km per pixel).
Several areas have been imaged at a resolution up to 300 m per
pixel. One difficulty in the data processing is to extract the
mineralogical composition, since rocks are mixtures of several
components. MELSUM is an algorithm that selects the best linear
combination of spectra among the families of minerals available
in a reference library. The best fit of the observed spectrum on
each pixel is calculated by the same unmixing equation used in
the classical Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). This study shows
the importance of the choice of the input library, which contains
in our case 24 laboratory spectra (endmembers) of minerals that
cover the diversity of the mineral families that may be found on
the Martian surface. The analysis is restricted to the 1.0--2.5
$\mu$m wavelength range. Grain size variations and atmospheric
scattering by aerosols induce changes in overall albedo level and
continuum slopes. Synthetic flat and pure slope spectra have
therefore been included in the input mineral spectral endmembers
library in order to take these effects into account. The
selection process for the endmembers is a systematic exploration
of whole set of combinations of four components plus the straight
line spectra. When negative coefficients occur, the results are
discarded. This strategy is successfully tested on the
terrestrial Cuprite site (Nevada, USA), for which extensive
ground observations exist. It is then applied to different areas
on Mars including Syrtis Major, Aram Chaos and Olympia Undae near
the North Polar Cap. MELSUM on Syrtis Major reveals a region
dominated by mafic minerals, with the oldest crustal regions
composed of a mixing between low-calcium pyroxenes (LCPs)
(orthopyroxenes (OPx)) and high-calcium pyroxenes (HCPs)
(clinopyroxenes (CPx)). The Syrtis volcanic edifice appears
depleted in LCP (OPx) and enriched in HCP (CPx), which is
consistent with materials produced with a lower partial fusion
degree at an age younger to the surrounding crust. Strong olivine
signatures are found between the two calderas Nili Patera and
Meroe Patera and in Nili Fossae. A strong signature of iron
oxides is found within Aram Chaos, with a spatial distribution

constrained to be on the order of 100 to 200 km. In addition, it
is noted that the most significant modes lead to the

importance of studying planetary evolution for a wide range of
initial conditions. We perform thermal evolution simulations for
generic terrestrial planets with masses ranging from that of Mars

convection with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity. Given
considerable uncertainty surrounding the dependency of mantle
rheology on pressure, we choose to focus on the end-member case
of pressure-independent potential viscosity, where viscosity does
not change with depth along an adiabatic temperature gradient. We
employ principal component analysis and linear regression to
capture the first-order systematics of possible evolutionary
scenarios from a large number of simulation runs. With increased
planetary mass, crustal thickness and the degree of mantle
processing are both predicted to decrease, and such size effects
can also be derived with simple scaling analyses. The likelihood
of plate tectonics is quantified using a mantle rheology that
takes into account both ductile and brittle deformation
mechanisms. Confirming earlier scaling analyses, the effects of
lithosphere hydration dominate the effects of planetary mass. The
possibility of basalt-eclogite phase transition in the planetary

that massive terrestrial planets may escape the stagnant-lid

abstract="We investigate the influence of tectonic mode on the
thermochemical evolution of simulated mantle convection coupled
to a parameterized core cooling model. The tectonic mode is
controlled by varying the friction coefficient for brittle
behavior, producing the three tectonic modes: mobile lid (plate
tectonics), stagnant lid, and episodic lid. The resulting
compositional structure of the deep mantle is strongly dependent
on tectonic mode, with episodic lid resulting in a thick layer of
subducted basalt in the deep mantle, whereas mobile lid produces
only isolated piles and stagnant lid no basaltic layering. The
tectonic mode is established early on, with subduction initiating
at around 60 Myr from the initial state in mobile and episodic
cases, triggered by the arrival of plumes at the base of the
lithosphere. Crustal production assists subduction initiation,
increasing the critical friction coefficient. The tectonic mode
has a strong effect on core evolution via its influence on deep
mantle structure; episodic cases in which a thick layer of basalt
builds up experience less core heat flow and cooling and a failed
geodynamo. Thus, a continuous mobile-lid mode existing from early

planets: From the view-point of mineral physics",
author="Karato, Shun-Ichiro",
abstract="Abstract Some mineral physics-related issues are reviewed that
are closely related to the operation of plate tectonics on
terrestrial planets with different mass. Plate tectonic style of
convection would occur when the surface layer has only modest
strength relative to the stress generated by mantle convection so
that it can deform and subduct into the mantle. Both the stress
on the lithosphere generated by mantle convection and the
resistance of the lithosphere for subduction depend on the
relevant materials properties. A review is presented on the
scaling relationships between relevant physical properties and
planet mass and on the strength of the lithosphere. It is shown
that if physically plausible scaling is made both for the
relevant materials properties and the macroscopic energy balance,
a large Earth-like planet may not necessarily have plate
tectonics. In addition to the internal processes, the surface
conditions such as the surface temperature may also play an
important role via its effects on the thickness of thermal or
chemical lithosphere, making it difficult for plate tectonics to
operate on small planets. Therefore, in this model, plate
tectonics would operate on planets with modest size like Earth,
but the validity of this conclusion hinges on the
characterization of (i) the influence of pressure-dependent
properties on the vigor of convection and of (ii) the resistance
for subduction. In particular, the processes determining the
resistance for subduction have an important influence on the
operation of plate tectonics. Key issues are highlighted that
require further studies including the influence of
depth-dependent properties on convection and the formulation of

abstract="The abundance of K in the silicate Earth provides control on the
composition of the Earth's interior, the dominant mode of mantle
convection, the thermal evolution of the planet, and the
concentration of Pb in the core. Because K acts as a volatile
species during accretion, the K content of the silicate Earth is
determined as a function of the terrestrial K/U ratio. A
comprehensive examination of MORB from the Atlantic, Indian and
Pacific oceans, including both normal- and enriched-type samples,
reveals a composite MORB source K/U ratio of 19,000 $\pm$ 2600
(2$\sigma$). In comparison, ocean island basalts and average
continental crust have average K/U values of 11,900 $\pm$ 2200

of these reservoirs establishes the K/U ratio of the silicate
Earth to be 13,800 $\pm$ 2600 (2$\sigma$), equating to 280 $\pm$
120 $\mu$g/g K in the silicate Earth. As a result, the planet's
convective Urey ratio is verified to be ~ 0.34, which indicates a
current mantle cooling rate of 70--130 K Gyr− 1 after taking into

Additionally, the Earth's balance of radiogenic heat flow and

observations; logistical constraints on the volume and mass of
samples and the volume/transfer of data collected; and paradigms
for evaluation of mission success. We find that the 2010 field

issues, and we recommend best practices and modifications to
training and operational protocols to address them. Underlying
our recommendations is the recognition that the capacity of the

author="Stamenkovi{\'c}, Vlada and Breuer, Doris",
abstract="Abstract A recent debate as to whether plate tectonics should
occur on super-Earths raises two questions: (1) how can this
disagreement between previous models be disentangled, and (2)
what controls the propensity of plate tectonics on Earth and
other planets? To tackle these questions, we use a 1D thermal
evolution model to study the ratio of driving to resistive forces
of plate tectonics for a variety of initial conditions, two
intrinsically different plate tectonics models, and for a large
range of model parameters. This wide approach allows us to
crystallize some fundamental factors driving plate tectonics. We
find that the way plate tectonics reacts to changes of interior
temperature is key for understanding how plate tectonics depends
on a planet's mass (and composition) and derive a new approach to
better constrain appropriate scaling parameters for 1D models
(i.e., for heat flux ($\beta$), convective velocity ($\gamma$),
and aspect ratio ($\epsilon$)). This allows us to track back the
discrepancy between various groups to different 1D scaling
parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$, $\epsilon$), or to different yield
stress scalings, interior temperatures, or initial conditions in
2D models. Our results also show that planet structure,
composition, and initial conditions significantly affect plate
tectonics. By re-analyzing previous 2D plate tectonics models and
setting them in relation to our results, we suggest that: (1)
increasing interior temperatures and planet mass make plate
tectonics less likely; (2) plate tectonics is more likely with
increasing mantle viscosity (if vigorously convecting) and not
generally with increasing Rayleigh number Ra. Moreover, our
results demonstrate that trying to understand distant worlds
teaches us how some present assumptions used to describe the
dynamics of the Earth (e.g., $\beta$ = 1/3, $\gamma$ = 2/3,
$\epsilon$ = 0, or plate tectonics more likely with increasing
Ra) might not be appropriate -- implying that we have to

allow reconstruction of a series of events, tectonic and thermal,

complementary to regional geological mapping, which is based on
less detailed images, but covers a broader sample of the surface.
The events reconstructed in this locale resurfaced about half the
area or more, so they probably ranged over a substantial fraction
of the age of Europa's surface, which in itself is quite young (<
50 Myr) due to the cumulative effects of such local (or regional)
reprocessing events acting over the entire globe. Chaotic terrain
was formed (probably by thermal processes) both early and late in
the sequence. Trends in changing geological processes that had
been inferred from lower-resolution images in regional geological
mapping efforts, especially an increase in formation of chaotic
terrain with time, which had been widely interpreted as implying
a thickening of the ice crust, are not evident in this area. The
impression that chaotic terrain is a relatively recent phenomenon
may come from the fact that older chaotic terrain can be more
difficult to identify, especially in the lower-resolution images
used for geological mapping. This study reinforces the conclusion
that both chaotic terrain and tectonic features have been formed

role in Phanerozoic orogenic systems of China",
author="Betts, Peter G and Moresi, Louis and Miller, Meghan S and Willis,

abstract="Abstract We present three 3D numerical models of deep subduction
where buoyant material from an oceanic plateau and a plume
interact with the overriding plate to assess the influence on
subduction dynamics, trench geometry, and mechanisms for plateau
accretion and continental growth. Transient instabilities of the
convergent margin are produced, resulting in: contorted trench
geometry; trench migration parallel with the plate margin;
folding of the subducting slab and orocline development at the
convergent margin; and transfer of the plateau to the overriding
plate. The presence of plume material beneath the oceanic plateau
causes flat subduction above the plume, resulting in a ``bowed''
shaped subducting slab. In plateau-only models, plateau accretion
at the edge of the overriding plate results in trench migration
around the edge of the plateau before subduction is
re-established directly behind the trailing edge of the plateau.
The plateau shortens and some plateau material subducts. The
presence of buoyant plume material beneath the oceanic plateau
has a profound influence on the behaviour of the convergent
margin. In the plateau + plume model, plateau accretion causes
rapid trench advance. Plate convergence is accommodated by
shearing at the base of the plateau and shortening in the
overriding plate. The trench migrates around the edge of the
plateau and subduction is re-established well behind the trailing
edge of the plateau, effectively embedding the plateau into the
overriding plate. A slab window forms beneath the accreted
plateau and plume material is transferred from the subducting
plate to the overriding plate through the window. In all of the
models, the subduction zone maintains a relatively stable
configuration away from the buoyancy anomalies within the
downgoing plate. The models provide a dynamic context for plateau
and plume accretion in Phanerozoic accretionary orogenic systems
such as the East China Orogen and the Central Asian Orogen
(Altiads), which are characterised by accreted ophiolite
complexes with diverse geochemical affinities, and a protracted

title="Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on
Earth",
author="van Heck, H J and Tackley, P J",
abstract="The discovery of extra-solar super-Earths has prompted interest
in their possible mantle dynamics and evolution, and in whether
their lithospheres are most likely to be undergoing active plate
tectonics like on Earth, or be stagnant lids like on Mars and
Venus. The origin of plate tectonics is poorly understood for
Earth, likely involving a complex interplay of rheological,
compositional, melting and thermal effects, which makes it
challenging to make reliable predictions for other planets.
Nevertheless, as a starting point it is common to parameterize
the complex processes involved as a simple yield stress that is
either constant or has a Byerlee's law dependence on pressure.
Because the simplifying assumptions made in developing analytical
scalings may not be valid over all parameter ranges, numerical
simulations are needed; one numerical study on super-Earths finds
that plate tectonics is less likely on a larger planet (O'Neill
and Lenardic (2007)), in apparent contradiction of an analytical
scaling study (Valencia et al. (2007)). To try and understand
this we here present new calculations of yielding-induced plate
tectonics as a function of planet size, focusing on the idealized
end members of internal heating or basal heating as well as
different strength profiles, and compared to analytical scalings.
In the present study we model super-Earths as simple scaled up
versions of Earth, i.e., assuming constant physical properties,
keeping the ratio of core/mantle radii constant and applying the
same temperature difference between top/bottom boundaries and the
same internal heating rate. Effects that originate outside of the
planet, such as tidal forces, meteor impacts and intense surface
heating from a nearby star are not considered. We find that for
internally-heated convection plate tectonics is equally likely
for terrestrial planets of any size, whereas for basally-heated
convection plate tectonics becomes more likely with increasing
planet size. This is indicated both by analytical scalings and
the presented numerical results, which agree with each other.
When scalings are adjusted to account for increasing mean density
with increasing planet size, plate tectonics becomes more likely
with increasing planet size for all scenarios. The influence of
the pressure variation of viscosity, thermal expansivity and
conductivity may, however, act in the opposite sense and needs to
be determined in future studies. At least in the simplest case,
factors other than planet size, such as the presence of surface
water, are likely most important for determining the presence or
absence of plate tectonics.",

been inferred to be of a similar rock and metal composition to
the Earth. As a result, the possibility that they are
characterised by the presence of plate tectonics has been widely
debated. However, as the super-Earths have higher masses than
Earth, it is assumed that they will also have higher Rayleigh
numbers and non-dimensional heating rates. Accordingly, we
conduct a systematic 2D study to investigate the influence of
these parameters on the surface behaviour of mantle convection.
The main focus of our work considers the response of surface
motion to the mantle's internal heating. However, we also include
an analysis of other parameters scaling with planet mass, such as
viscosity. In agreement with the findings of Valencia and
O'Connell (2009) and van Heck and Tackley (2011) we find
plate-like surface mobilisation for increased Rayleigh numbers.
But increasing the internal heating leads to the formation of a
strong stagnant-lid because the mantle heating effects thermally
activated viscosity. Additionally, viscosity is affected by the
increased pressures and temperatures of super-Earths. In total,
our findings indicate that surface mobility will likely be
reduced on super-sized Earths. Our numerical models show that the

inactive desert, Mars probably came to rest within the first
billion years of its history, and Venus, although internally very
active, has a dry inferno for its surface. Here we review the
parameters that determined the fates of each of these planets and
their geochemical expressions. The strong gravity field of a
large planet allows for an enormous amount of gravitational
energy to be released, causing the outer part of the planetary
body to melt (magma ocean), helps retain water on the planet, and
increases the pressure gradient. The weak gravity field and
anhydrous conditions prevailing on the Moon stabilized, on top of
its magma ocean, a thick buoyant plagioclase lithosphere, which
insulated the molten interior. On Earth, the buoyant hydrous
phases (serpentines) produced by reactions between the
terrestrial magma ocean and the wet impactors received from the
outer solar system isolated the magma and kept it molten for some
few tens of million years. The planets from the inner solar
system accreted dry: foundering of wet surface material softened
the terrestrial mantle and set the scene for the onset of plate
tectonics. This very same process also may have removed all the
water from the surface of Venus and added enough water to its
mantle to make its internal dynamics very strong and keep the
surface very young. Because of a radius smaller than that of the
Earth, not enough water could be drawn into the Martian mantle
before it was lost to space and Martian plate tectonics never
began. The radius of a planet is therefore the key parameter

author="Piper, John D A",
abstract="Abstract Plate Tectonics requires a specific range of thermal,
fluid and compositional conditions before it will operate to
mobilise planetary lithospheres. The response to interior heat
dispersion ranges from mobile lids in constant motion able to
generate zones of subduction and spreading (Plate Tectonics),
through styles of Lid Tectonics expressed by stagnant lids
punctured by volcanism, to lids alternating between static and
mobile. The palaeomagnetic record through Earth history provides
a test for tectonic style because a mobile Earth of multiple
continents is recorded by diverse apparent polar wander paths,
whilst Lid Tectonics is recorded by conformity to a single
position. The former is difficult to isolate without extreme
selection whereas the latter is a demanding requirement and
easily recognised. In the event, the Precambrian palaeomagnetic
database closely conforms to this latter property over very long
periods of time (~ 2.7--2.2 Ga, 1.5--1.3 Ga and 0.75--0.6 Ga);
intervening intervals are characterised by focussed loops
compatible with episodes of true polar wander stimulated by
disturbances to the planetary figure. Because of this singular
property, the Precambrian palaeomagnetic record is highly
effective in showing that a dominant Lid Tectonics operated
throughout most of Earth history. A continental lid comprising at
least 60\% of the present continental area and volume had
achieved quasi-integrity by 2.7 Ga. Reconfiguration of mantle and
continental lid at ~ 2.2 Ga correlates with isotopic signatures

Earth history to the resurfacing of Venus. Change from Lid
Tectonics to Plate Tectonics is transitional and the geological

author="Klimczak, Christian and Byrne, Paul K and Solomon, Sean C",
abstract="Abstract Mercury's global tectonic history is thought to have
been dominated by two major processes: tidal despinning and
global contraction. Each process is expected to have produced a
distinctive global stress field and resultant fault pattern.
Thousands of thrust-fault-related landforms documented on Mercury
can be attributed to global contraction, but no global signature
of tidal despinning has been conclusively documented. Because
global contraction operated throughout an extended portion of
Mercury's geologic history, any tidal despinning pattern either
would have formed together with global contraction, or would have
been modified by global contraction after despinning was
complete. Here, we reassess global fracture patterns predicted to
result from tidal despinning and from a combination of tidal
despinning and global contraction. We specifically make use of
rock strength and deformability parameters appropriate for
Mercury's fractured lithosphere. Results indicate that a tidal
despinning pattern would consist only of a global set of
opening-mode fractures (joints) in the upper part of the
lithosphere, whereas the combination of tidal despinning and
global contraction would have produced a global population of
thrust faults, with no preferred orientations in the polar
regions but with an increasing preference for north--south
orientations toward the equator. If an equatorial bulge from an
early state of rapid spin was supported by Mercury's lithosphere,
two end-member scenarios for the timing and duration of these two
processes may be considered. In one, tidal despinning predated
global contraction; in the other, tidal despinning and global
contraction overlapped in time. We test the predictions of both
scenarios against the distribution and orientations of Mercury's
tectonic landforms. The global pattern of thrust faults is
generally consistent with predictions for the scenario under
which tidal despinning and global contraction temporally
overlapped.",

between 520 and 490 Ma, inboard of the plate margin that
coincides with the cessation of collisional orogenesis between
the amalgamating blocks of Gondwana. Supra-subduction zone
igneous activity was continuous throughout this period indicating
that subduction was ongoing. The final stages of assembly of the
Pangean supercontinent occurred between c.320 and 250 Ma. Major
plate boundary reorganization during this time was accompanied by
regional orogenesis along the Pacific margin. The East Gondwana
margin segment experienced transpressional and transtensional
activity from c.305 Ma until c.270 Ma, after which convergence
along the plate margin was re-established. In eastern Australia
this involved a migration of arc magmatism eastward into the old
subduction complex indicating a stepping out of the plate margin.
Synchronous with this phase of plate re-adjustment was the
Gondwanide Orogeny (305--230 Ma) affecting the entire Pacific
margin of Pangea. Temporal relations across supercontinents
between interior collisional and marginal accretionary orogenies
suggest a linked history between interior and exterior processes
perhaps related to global plate kinematic adjustments. Orogenesis
in accretionary orogens occurs in the absence of colliding bodies
during ongoing subduction and plate convergence and must
therefore be driven by a transitory coupling across the plate
boundary. Correspondence of coupling with, or immediately
following, subduction initiation and plate boundary
reorganization, suggests it may reflect plate re-adjustments
involving a temporary phase of increased relative convergence
across the plate boundary.",

title="Density of {MORB} eclogite in the upper mantle",
author="Aoki, Ichiro and Takahashi, Eiichi",
abstract="In order to study the role of eclogite (subducted oceanic crust)
in geodynamics, we carried out high-pressure experiments on
natural mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB) using a multi-anvil
apparatus. We determined phase relations of MORB as a function of
pressure and temperature in the temperature range of 1200--1700
°C and pressures from 5 to 14 GPa. The present results differ
from a previous high-pressure study of MORB ([Earth Planet. Sci.
Lett. 77 (1986) 245]; conducted at 1200 °C) as follows: (1)
coesite (Coe) or stishovite (St) appears throughout the studied
pressure range; and (2) the clinopyroxene/garnet (Cpx/Gar) ratio
is smaller, particularly in the low-pressure range (<12 GPa). Our
results show that the calculated bulk density of subducted
oceanic crust increases discontinuously at around 9 GPa due to
the coesite--stishovite phase transition. The density is
considerably higher than estimates based on the previous
experiments at pressures less than 12 GPa. Thus, the role of
eclogite in driving subduction should be more important than
previously thought. On the other hand, the density difference
between peridotite and eclogite in ascending mantle plumes
becomes smaller as temperature increases, a result of the
increase in clinopyroxene/(garnet+SiO2) ratio in eclogite with
increasing temperature. As eclogite is still denser than
peridotite even under subsolidus conditions, recycled oceanic
crust entrained in ascending plumes must be sustained by the
upward flow of ambient peridotite in mantle plumes.",

title="A theoretical framework for volcanic degassing chemistry in a
comparative planetology perspective and implications for
planetary atmospheres",
author="Gaillard, Fabrice and Scaillet, Bruno",
abstract="Abstract Magmatic degassing is ubiquitous and enduring, yet its
impact on both planetary surficial chemistry and how it may have
varied among planetary systems remains imprecise. A large number
of factors are likely to be involved in the control of magmatic
gas compositions, leading roles being given to the redox state
and volatile abundances in planetary interiors, and the fate of
the latter during mantle melting. We however show that the
pressure at which degassing occurs, that is the atmospheric
pressure in most sensible cases, has a prime influence on the
composition of subaerial volcanic gases on planets: high surface
pressure produces N2- and CO2-rich and dry volcanic gases, while
low pressure promotes sulfur-rich gases. In-between, atmospheric
pressures close to 1 bar trigger volcanic gases dominated by H2O.
This simple pattern broadly mirrors the atmospheres of
Venus--Earth--Mars--Io planetary suite and constitutes benchmarks
for the prediction and interpretation of atmospheric features of
extra-solar planets. Volatile abundances within the planetary
body interiors also matter but they play a secondary role.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that any difference in redox
conditions prevailing during partial melting tends to disappear
with the degassing process itself, converging toward a unique --
planetary oxygen fugacity -- at the venting pressure. A feedback
relationship between volcanic gas compositions and atmospheric
pressure implies a runaway drying during atmospheric growth; that
is volcanic gases must become CO2 richer as the atmospheric mass
increases. This may explain some features of the Venusian
atmosphere. On Earth, impact ejection of the atmosphere and
CO2-sink mechanisms, such as carbonate precipitation and plate
tectonics, must have decreased atmospheric pressure allowing the
reestablishment of water-rich volcanic gases.",

title="Mantle convection with a brittle lithosphere: thoughts on the
global tectonic styles of the Earth and Venus",
author="Moresi, Louis and Solomatov, Viatcheslav",
abstract="Plates are an integral part of the convection system in the fluid
mantle, but plate boundaries are the product of brittle faulting
and plate motions are strongly influenced by the existence of
such faults. The conditions for plate tectonics are studied by
considering brittle behaviour, using Byerlee's law to limit the
maximum stress in the lithosphere, in a mantle convection model
with temperature-dependent viscosity. When the yield stress is
high, convection is confined below a thick, stagnant lithosphere.
At low yield stress, brittle deformation mobilizes the
lithosphere which becomes a part of the overall circulation;
surface deformation occurs in localized regions close to
upwellings and downwellings in the system. At intermediate levels
of the yield stress, there is a cycling between these two states:
thick lithosphere episodically mobilizes and collapses into the
interior before reforming. The mobile-lid regime resembles
convection of a fluid with temperature-dependent viscosity and
the boundary-layer scalings are found to be analogous. This
regime has a well defined Nusselt number--Rayleigh number
relationship which is in good agreement with scaling theory. The
surface velocity is nearly independent of the yield stress,
indicating that the `plate' motion is resisted by viscous
stresses in the mantle. Analysis suggests that mobilization of
the Earth's lithosphere can occur if the friction coefficient in
the lithosphere is less than 0.03--0.13---lower than laboratory
values but consistent with seismic field studies. On Venus, the
friction coefficient may be high as a result of the dry
conditions, and brittle mobilization of the lithosphere would
then be episodic and catastrophic.",

the lithospheric age. Buoyancy also depends on compositional
layering resulting from pressure release partial melting under
mid-ocean ridges, and this process is sensitive to pressure and
temperature conditions which vary strongly between the
terrestrial planets and also during the secular cooling histories
of the planets. In our modelling experiments we have applied a
range of values for the gravitational acceleration (representing
different terrestrial planets), potential temperatures
(representing different times in the history of the planets), and
surface temperatures in order to investigate under which
conditions plate tectonics is a viable mechanism for the cooling
of the terrestrial planets. In our models we include the effects
of mantle temperature on the composition and density of melt
products and the thickness of the lithosphere. Our results show
that the onset time of negative buoyancy for oceanic lithosphere
is reasonable (less than a few hundred million years) for
potential temperatures below ∼1500 °C for the Earth and ∼1450 °C
for Venus. In the reduced gravity field of Mars a much thicker

of Titan's surface geology. Here we use Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SAR) image swaths (Ta--T30) obtained from October 2004 to
December 2007 to infer the geologic processes that have shaped
Titan's surface. These SAR swaths cover about 20\% of the
surface, at a spatial resolution ranging from ∼350 m to ∼2 km.
The SAR data are distributed over a wide latitudinal and
longitudinal range, enabling some conclusions to be drawn about
the global distribution of processes. They reveal a geologically
complex surface that has been modified by all the major geologic
processes seen on Earth -- volcanism, tectonism, impact
cratering, and erosion and deposition by fluvial and aeolian
activity. In this paper, we map geomorphological units from SAR
data and analyze their areal distribution and relative ages of
modification in order to infer the geologic evolution of Titan's
surface. We find that dunes and hummocky and mountainous terrains
are more widespread than lakes, putative cryovolcanic features,
mottled plains, and craters and crateriform structures that may
be due to impact. Undifferentiated plains are the largest areal
unit; their origin is uncertain. In terms of latitudinal
distribution, dunes and hummocky and mountainous terrains are
located mostly at low latitudes (less than 30°), with no dunes
being present above 60°. Channels formed by fluvial activity are
present at all latitudes, but lakes are at high latitudes only.
Crateriform structures that may have been formed by impact appear
to be uniformly distributed with latitude, but the well-preserved
impact craters are all located at low latitudes, possibly
indicating that more resurfacing has occurred at higher
latitudes. Cryovolcanic features are not ubiquitous, and are
mostly located between 30° and 60° north. We examine temporal
relationships between units wherever possible, and conclude that
aeolian and fluvial/pluvial/lacustrine processes are the most
recent, while tectonic processes that led to the formation of
mountains and Xanadu are likely the most ancient.",

contributions from heat entering the mantle from the core, as
well as mantle cooling, radiogenic heating of the mantle from
the decay of radioactive elements, and various minor processes
such as tidal deformation, chemical segregation and thermal
contraction gravitational heating. The increased estimates of
deep-mantle heat flow indicate a more prominent role for thermal

Mars",

volcanotectonic construct in northern Tharsis, Mars. Numerous
models have been presented to explain the formation of Alba Mons
and its most characteristic feature, a wristwatch-like pattern of
radial and circumferential graben. We used a wide selection of
topographic datasets to characterize the fault throw variation on
nine topographic transects across the circumferential graben in
order to provide observational constraints for the different
formation models, and to gain further insight into the evolution
of Alba Mons. In most of the transects, summed throws from
outwards-facing (away from the center of the volcano) faults are
larger than from the inwards-facing (towards the center) ones.
Only the very gently sloping western transects show the opposite,
emphasizing the east--west-asymmetry of Alba Mons. 10--40\% of
the observed topographic relief of Alba Mons along the nine
transects can be accounted for by this throw difference between
the inwards- and outwards-facing faults. These results are
consistent with predictions of models suggesting an uplift
mechanism to explain the formation of the circumferential graben,
but not with models invoking central subsidence. Horizontal

volcanism. Here we present paleomagnetic evidence for periods of

episodic tectonics in the Precambrian, where higher mantle
temperatures result in lower lithospheric stresses, causing rapid
pulses of subduction interspersed with periods of relative

hotter mantle temperatures of the early Earth and can explain

uncertainties, there are no obvious fractionations between CI
meteorites and solar abundances. Further progress will primarily
come from improved solar abundance determinations. The limiting
factor in the accuracy of meteorite abundances is the inherent
heterogeneity of CI chondrites, primarily the Orgueil meteorite.
