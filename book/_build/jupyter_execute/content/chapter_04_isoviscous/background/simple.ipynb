    "Due to their relative simplicity and amenability to symbolic analysis, isoviscous models were among the earliest published mantle convection models {cite}`McKenzie1973-gt,McKenzie1974-wb,Jarvis1986-me,Blankenbach1989-li`, and they continue to be produced and discussed today {cite}`Zhong2005-lh,Weller2016-cc,Weller2016-nm,Vilella2018-il`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an isoviscous model, the viscosity function (usually set to $\\eta=1$) is constant throughout space and time. Though simple, it is nevertheless able to reproduce appropriate surface velocities, gravitational profiles, and even topographic wavelengths {cite}`McKenzie1973-gt,McKenzie1974-wb`. Though its parameters are few, there remain limitless possible variations through *Rayleigh* number, internal heat $H$, domain geometry, and choice of boundary condition - many of which boast long-term stability solutions with enough implicit nonlinearity to make purely analytical studies infeasible {cite}`Daly1980-xl`. Even within each parameter set, chaotic dynamics ensure that two nearly identical configurations may yet have wildly divergent outcomes {cite}`Stewart1989-os,Palymskiy2003-fq`. And while the isoviscous model is certainly the most computationally tractable of all mantle-like rheologies, it is only in the last decade that long-run simulations of appropriate scale for the Earth ($Ra>10^7$) have become possible {cite}`Vynnycky2013-wg,Trubitsyn2018-jo`; these have confirmed earlier intuitions that stable convective planforms may either not exist, or may never manifest, on planetary spatiotemporal scales {cite}`Huttig2011-jt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the isoviscous model does bely considerable complexity, it is simple enough to make some solutions analytically attainable. Like all convecting systems, a 'critical' *Rayleigh* number $Ra_{cr}$ should exist below which convection ceases and conduction dominates (i.e. $Nu=1$), defining a 'supercritical $Ra$':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R \\equiv \\frac{Ra}{Ra_{cr}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "At $R=1$, perturbations of a certain 'critical' wavelength are uniquely able to grow faster than the conductive geotherm and hence become unstable; increasing $R$ beyond $1$ makes more wavelengths available for convective growth, until at extreme values ($Ra >> 10^7$) even artificial heterogeneities introduced by random noise can grow, such that large-scale models become overwhelmingly time-dependent {cite}`Jarvis1984-xo`. For a plane domain of infinite horizontal extent, the critical wavelength $\\lambda_{cr}$ should be exactly $\\sqrt{2}$ {cite}`Chandrasekhar1961-ez`, corresponding to a $Ra_{cr}$ of exactly {cite}`Malkus1954-ee`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ra_{cr} = \\frac{27\\pi^4}{4} \\approx 657.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In any real system, however, $A$ cannot be infinite, and may be literally or effectively compressed such that the critical wavelength is no longer available. The effect of this is to create a dependency of $Ra_{cr}$ on $A$ {cite}`Chandrasekhar1961-ez`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ra_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^4 \\left( 1 + A^2 \\right)^3}{A^4} $$\n",

    "At the unit aspect ratios typically modelled, for instance, $Ra_{cr}$ should instead approach ({cite}`Grover1968-wa`):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ra_{cr} = 2^3\\pi^4 \\approx 779.3 $$\n",

    "A value which is borne out in laboratory testing {cite}`Whitehead2011-gs`.\n",

    "While heat may be transported by convection in the interior of the system, heat may only cross in or out of the system as a whole via conduction. This occurs across two thin layers at the outer and inner boundaries. Since we stipulate that these layers are purely conductive, a *Rayleigh* number defined only across each layer must be below the critical value for that layer: ${Ra}_{layer} < {{Ra}_{layer}}_{cr}$ `Olson1987-do`. This is the first observation of boundary layer theory, whence can be deduced the following fundamental power law relationship between the *Rayleigh* and *Nusselt* numbers {cite}`Schubert2001-ea`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Nu \\propto Ra^{\\beta}, \\quad \\beta \\to \\frac{1}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number. The coefficient of proportionality is theoretically $\\approx 0.1941$ {cite}`Olson1987-do`, though it has been argued that its value will tend be dominated by uncertainty in practice {cite}`Lenardic2003-wd`; reported values have ranged between $0.25-0.27$ {cite}`Olson1987-do,Jarvis1989-qj`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivalent scaling {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua` has instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Nu \\propto R^{\\beta} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R$, again, is the proportion by which $Ra$ exceeds $Ra_{cr}$. Defining $Ra$ in this way preserves the value of $\\beta$ insofar as $Ra^{cr}$ is independent of it, but allows the coefficient of proportionality to relate more strictly to non-thermal factors like the domain geometry - for example the aspect ratio, which (above a certain threshold) has been observed to stretch or compress the planform horizontally without changing the underlying boundary stability criteria {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, at the state where $Nu$ satisfies this scaling, the interior of each cell becomes a homogeneous region of uniform temperature $T^{cell}$ and variable but low velocities, with strong gradients and shears at the margins, and overall cell dimensions approaching an aspect ratio of $\\sqrt{2}$. Because of the fixed temperature scale, the only way heat transport can be enhanced in such a system is by thinning the boundary layers, which in practice occurs by dripping/pluming until only the theoretical stable boundary thickness is left. For this reason, $Nu$ also functions as a useful proxy for boundary layer thickness when this is otherwise hard to define.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical *beta* scaling is seductive because it connects the relatively well-constrained fact of surface geothermal flux with the more mysterious thermal state of the mantle, and so allows parameterised thermal histories to be projected through deep time. The $\\beta \\to \\frac{1}{3}$ limit itself ultimately derives from the *Rayleigh* number's dependence on length cubed, and while there is no *a priori* reason to believe that this analytical justification must be borne out in practice, it has been recognised as extremely suggestive for over half a century {cite}`Chan1971-xv`. Testing this scaling behaviour empirically was an early priority of computational geodynamics, with several studies producing estimates that converged on, but did not achieve, the theoretical $\\frac{1}{3}$ scaling: the value has been reported as any of $0.313$ {cite}`Jarvis1982-ua`, $0.318$ {cite}`Jarvis1986-me`, $0.319$ {cite}`Schubert1985-sy`, $0.326$ {cite}`Jarvis1989-qj`, $0.36$ {cite}`Quareni1985-ff`, and $0.31$ {cite}`Niemela2000-cu`, using various methods both numerical and laboratory-based. The reason for the deviation is uncertain. One possibility is that the boundary layer instability theory is only valid in the limit $Ra\\to\\infty$ {cite}`Olson1987-do`. Alternatively, high $Ra$ values may witness transitions to alternate scaling logics altogether - perhaps lowering $beta$  It was for a time suggested that, at very high *Rayleigh* numbers, an 'asymptotic regime' of $\\beta \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ might emerge, but this has not yet been observed {cite}`Niemela2000-cu`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *beta* scaling strictly holds only for those isoviscous systems with purely basal (no volumetric) heating, Cartesian geometry, and free-slip boundaries, it has been found to hold for a wide range of systems if certain corrections are made."
